struggled for a little while with Bayes' Theorem. I could use the formulas, but I didn't grok the concept.\nThere are two popular camps in probability: the Frequentist camp and the Bayesian camp. Let's say we're interested in the probability that it rains tomorrow in San Francisco (let's say $p = 0.35$).\n\nThe Frequentists see that probability and think, \"If we simulated tomorrow a lot of times (approaching an infinite number of times), then 35% of those simulations will have rain.\"\nThe Bayesians, on the other hand think, \"We're 35% confident that it'll rain tomorrow.\" They see probabilities as confidence scores on a scale from 0 to 1.\n\nThe Bayesian view is often convenient: if you're a frequentist, it doesn't really make immediate sense to say, \"There's a 3% chance that nuclear war breaks out in the next 10 years.\" We aren't looking into 1000 alternative 10-year timelines and saying \"Nuclear war breaks out in 30 of them.\" No. We're saying that we're 3% confident that nuclear war will happen in our 10-year timeline.\nBayes' Theorem\nA Bayesian view of probability also allows us to update our beliefs (confidence scores) when given new information. The classic example is the medical diagnosis: Say we know that COVID-19 occurs in 8% of the general population, the test identifies 99% of people who actually have COVID, and any random person tests positive with 10% probability.\nIf we take any random person, we're 8% confident that they have COVID. But if we're given that they test positive, we can use Bayes' Theorem to update our beliefs.\n\nThe number 8% is our prior probability (belief) that the person has COVID\nWe can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior probability that the person has COVID. This is the probability after we've factored in the given information (that they tested positive).\n\nWe want to find the probability $P(C|+)$, the probability the person has COVID ($C$) given that they've tested positive ($+$). Using the definition of conditional probability,\n\n$$\nP(C|+) = \\frac{P(C \\text{ and } +)}{P(+)} \\tag{1}\n$$\n$$\nP(+|C) = \\frac{P(C \\text{ and } +)}{P(C)} \\implies\nP(C \\text{ and } +) = P(+|C)P(C)\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nThen, when we substitute the final result from $(2)$ into $(1)$, we see that\n\n$$\nP(C|+) = \\frac{P(+|C)P(C)}{P(+)} \\tag{3}\n$$\n\nThis is Bayes' Theorem! If we plug in our numbers, then we get that:\n\n$$\nP(C|+) = \\frac{0.99 \\cdot 0.08}{0.10} = 0.792\n$$\n\nThe end result is counterintuitive—if someone told you the test has a 99% true positive rate (meaning that it correctly identifies 99% of people with COVID), then you might be pretty worried. There's a high chance the person has COVID, given they tested positive, but it's not as straightforward as it might seem because COVID isn't that common in the general population.\nInterpreting Bayes' Theorem, Qualitatively\nIt's possible to apply the idea of Bayes' Theorem to everyday life as well! Even without actual numbers, we can see how the formula behaves when certain values are small/large:\nIf a reliable news source (you are very confident they will publish any truthful story) releases an article about an extremely unlikely event (aliens landing on the surface of Earth), then it makes sense to be skeptical.\n\n$$\nP(\\text{truthful} | \\text{published}) = \\frac{P(\\text{published} | \\text{truthful})P(\\text{truthful})}{P(\\text{published})}\n$$\n\nLet's break this down again:\n\n$P(\\text{truthful} | \\text{published})$ is what we're interested in: it's our posterior. We can use this to represent our trust (higher posterior probability means higher trust).\nMaybe you're confident they will publish any truthful story they come across, so $P(\\text{published} | \\text{truthful})$ is high. This is called the likelihood. More on this in a second.\nAliens landing on Earth is very improbable (given our current beliefs), so $P(\\text{truthful})$ is low. This is the prior.\n\nSince aliens are unlikely to land on Earth (the prior is low), then our posterior will also be lower because of this.\n\n\n$P(\\text{published})$ is the probability any story is published by the source. This is called the marginal.\n\nIf they don't publish a lot of stories, then our trust (posterior belief) increases. If they publish too many stories, then our trust won't be as high.\n\n\nLet's consider how the marginal and likelihood together affect the posterior:\n\nIf the news outlet publishes a lot of the true stories that are out there, but it doesn't publish a lot of stories in general, then our posterior belief will be quite high.\nIf the news outlet doesn't publish a lot of the truthful stories that are out there, and if the outlet does publish a lot of stories, then we shouldn't have much confidence that aliens have actually landed.\n\n\n\nI originally intended for this post to be brief, but it's become more of a rant than I expected. But if we're trying to make more informed and rational decisions when given new information, perhaps Bayes' Theorem is a useful tool.\n","id":"https://tanaybiradar.com/blog/a-bit-about-bayes-theorem/","title":"A bit about Bayes' Theorem"},"https://tanaybiradar.com/blog/a-smallish-set-of-productivity-tools/":{"body":"The best camera is the one you use. The best sunscreen is the one you use. The best productivity tools are the ones you actually use.\nOver-optimizing your workflow is largely a waste of time.\nWhat has had real impact? Sticking to (mostly) simple, battle-tested tools over long periods of time.\nThat said, here's yet another list of productivity apps on the internet:\n\n\nObsidian is my default writing app. I love that it's powerful but not complicated; the designers believe that \"software is ephemeral\", but files are long-lasting. I use its Daily Notes plugin to jot down random thoughts and ideas; each daily note also has a to-do list, which rolls over unfinished tasks from the previous day.\n\n\nStandard Notes is a neat but (very) simple tool. I'm not always at my computer to use Obsidian, so if I have an sudden idea or need to write something quickly, I use the mobile app. I also use it for things like grocery shopping.\n\n\nGoodNotes is what I use for note-taking on my iPad. I typically use it as a scratchpad, but I also project GoodNotes when teaching Data Science Club workshops. I also use it to annotate machine learning papers. To sync annotated papers with my laptop, I use a file server on my homelab.\n\n\nApple Calendar is quite vanilla, but I have it sync to a Radicale server to give me full control over my data. I have separate calendars for classes, extracurricular activities, and other activities (such as climbing). If I need to do something at a specific time, I put it on my calendar by default.\n\n\niTerm2, Vim, and VSCodium are the developer tools I use most often. I spend most of my development time in the terminal, but I open VSCodium when I need to work with Jupyter notebooks. I only use VSCode occasionally to utilize GitHub Copilot.\n\n\nHomebrew, Hammerspoon, SKHD, and Yabai are MacOS automation tools. Homebrew is my package manager, which installs and updates all applications on my computer. With Hammerspoon, I can write scripts in Lua that directly open any app with a hotkey. SKHD and Yabai, meanwhile, help me split and resize windows with just a few keypresses. Together, these tools help me avoid constantly reaching for the trackpad—which seems unnecessary but has helped me context-switch between applications effortlessly.\n\n\n","id":"https://tanaybiradar.com/blog/a-smallish-set-of-productivity-tools/","title":"Tools I like to use"},"https://tanaybiradar.com/blog/actually-reading-ai-research-papers/":{"body":"A while ago, I wrote this post about reading AI research papers. Those were just some notes I made public; I had hardly read any papers then.\nSince last September, however, things have changed. I'm taking two paper-based classes (Adversarial Robustness in Machine Learning, LLMs + Conversational AI). I'm also leading GAIA, where we read yet more papers. With these experiences under my belt, I can finally say a little more.\nReading Wide vs. Reading Deep\nHarvard's CS197 suggests to split reading into two parts: Reading wide vs. reading deep. I talk more about this in my previous post.\n\nReading wide: Use this to \"learn what you don't know\" and build a mental model of the topic.\nRead deep to get a better idea of what techniques researchers use, what benchmarks are popular, and to get context in the field.\n\nKnow Thy Field\nResearch papers are written by experts for experts; they're dense and full of jargon. That's why we have to \"read wide\" to understand the key terms—find the papers that are foundational to the field.\nBut reading wide is a lot more effective when you know what to read in the first place.\nIf you're trying to get into a field, it's useful to find someone who has experience in the field and can direct your reading. In my Adversarial Robustness in ML course, I have the good fortune to have a professor who sends a sequence of papers to read each week.\nIf you don't have that luxury, however, it may be useful to email someone who studies that area and ask for good papers. Alternatively, when reading wide, make a mental note of the authors that often receive citations and look up those papers. There will often be a paper trail to some works that provide excellent background! Tools like Connected Papers and Google Scholar can also be really useful to find related works.\nRead Deep\nWhen selecting papers to read deeply, try to understand as much as possible: The equations, the figures, the surrounding work. That said, don't unnecessarily bang your head against a wall.\nThe first few papers take a very long time to read—but as you get more familiar with the structure of research papers and the jargon of your field, the reading time drops. After reading both widely and deeply, you start to realize a few things:\n\nAfter reading wide, the introduction and background sections often contain information you're already familiar with. After some time, you can just skim these.\nThe parts with the highest ROI on time are the motivation, the architecture, and (maybe) the experiments.\nThe papers you read start to feel like a conversation. Each paper examines the state of the field, finds a flaw or limitation of existing work, and proposes something better. The authors then defend their work with experiments and highlight some places for future researchers to improve upon.\nYou can start formulating your own questions and criticisms. Maybe you even find ideas for future work!\n\nFor a while, I couldn't read papers very well. I just read whatever seemed interesting at the time. Even after taking the advice of the CS197 lecture notes (which has definitely been useful!), I still wasn't comfortable with reading papers.\nBut with a reading strategy, following research suddenly became a lot more enjoyable. By knowing the field and reading deep, I've been able to skim papers for the main ideas, come up with my own ideas for research, and follow talks by researchers.\n","id":"https://tanaybiradar.com/blog/actually-reading-ai-research-papers/","title":"Actually Reading AI Research Papers"},"https://tanaybiradar.com/blog/an-overachievers-guide-to-college/":{"body":"Very, Very Important Disclaimer: This is not general advice. This is extremely opinionated, doesn't have a lot of nuance, and is definitely not for everyone. None of this is prescriptive; it's just what worked for me, a CS major at UCSB. Keep this at the front of your mind while reading this.\n\nThis June, I graduated from UCSB. It's been a really short 3 years, and I'll always look back on them fondly. I've learned a lot since my first day. Here are my distilled thoughts.\n\nMost \"how to succeed at college\" advice focuses on the basics. Some of the advice is genuinely helpful: learn to manage your time, attend office hours, and get involved on campus. Other advice was terrible for me: avoid taking more than N classes per quarter, don't push yourself too hard, and wait until you've taken the foundational classes before you do anything else. The problem is that I don't operate that way. I need to figure out where my limits are, and I'm motivated by exploring topics I find exciting. I can fill in some of the gaps as I go.\nMost college advice is (rightfully) aimed at the common-case student who wants to get good grades and is navigating the ropes of college. But what's next?\nThat's why I'm calling this \"An Overachiever's Guide to College.\" At the risk of sounding pretentious, this is not advice for the common-case student. This is the advice that I wish I heard as a freshman CS major at UCSB. It's a compilation of my learnings so far, including what many of your seniors, professors, and academic advisors probably won't tell you.\nOutline\n\nPhilosophy\nThe Pillars of Self-Maintenance\nAcademic Strategy\n\nPreface/Disclaimer\nThe \"Advanced\" Academic Strategy\n\n\nGeneral Education (GEs)\nMajor Classes\n\nLower-Division Classes\nUpper-Division Classes\nGraduate Classes\n\n\nExtracurriculars\n\nClubs\nResearch\nInternships\nNoncanonical Activities\n\n\nConclusion\nOther Good Advice\n\nPhilosophy\nThis guide is aimed at \"getting the most out of the college experience,\" loosely defined as finding a career path that you'll enjoy, academically preparing yourself as much as possible, and taking advantage of the many social + academic resources that college offers.\nIn order for it to be useful, you'll first need to know what you want from college. But knowing what you want starts from a personal philosophy. Here are some of the principles I use:\n\nPersonal Growth and SGD\n\n\nYou don't always need an end goal; you just need a direction. At any given moment, you need to be clear about what you're doing: weighing different options, gathering data, figuring out what you want.\n\n\nDon't Waste Your Life\n\n\nWhen I think of a life not wasted, I think about constantly trying to become an excellent person—whatever that means. I think of experimenting with silly ideas and building things. I think of taking care of the people around me and doing \"good\" (defined in some reasonable way) for other people. I think of continuously learning something and doing Hard Things from time to time.\n\n\nHow to Waste Your Life\n\n\nAs my good friend Riley told me in a conversation, \"We weren't given a main quest at birth.\" life isn't an optimization problem. But I can't help but feel that something's missing if you didn't explore the possibilities.\n\nWhatever you do, do it with intention. Avoid falling into the easy traps of doing things solely because other people are doing them. Ask yourself, \"Is there a deeper reason I'm spending my time on this?\"\nSecondly, follow the golden advice of Ranchoddas Chanchad from 3 Idiots (clip):\n\nKabil hone ke liye padho. Success ke piche mat bhago. Excellence, excellence ka picha karo. Success tumhare jhak maar ke peeche aayegi.\n\"Study for the sake of becoming more capable. Don't run after success. Excellence, excellence is what you should chase. Success will easily come after you.\"\n\nLastly, as a disclaimer, not all of this advice applies all of the time. You might need the exact opposite!\nThe Pillars of Self-Maintenance\nI've seen absolute academic weapons pull all-nighters and sacrifice too much for their work, but I don't operate that way. Before optimizing my academics and extracurriculars, I need to satisfy my basic needs. (It sometimes makes sense to make sacrifices for a short-term goal or project. But I like to think that I prefer steady, sustainable growth over ephemeral bursts of energy.)\nI'm no dietician, sleep scientist, or doctor, but I try to always maintain these fundamental pillars. This is all stuff that you know you should be doing:\n\nFood\n\nIn the words of Michael Pollan, \"Eat [real] food. Not too much. Mostly plants.\" In college, it's easy and socially acceptable to skip meals and subsist on a diet of instant ramen. Don't do it.\n\n\nSleep\n\nEveryone needs different amounts of sleep. Find out how much you need to get through the day without fatigue. Good sleep has too many benefits to ignore.\n\n\nExercise\n\nI aim to get exercise in at least 3 days a week. It doesn't really matter what it is—lifting, running, swimming—but it has to be meaningful in volume. When I regularly work out, I'm more energetic and my mind is clearer.\n\n\nMedical\n\nDon't neglect your fundamental physical/mental health needs. Without these, you won't be able to work as effectively, and you won't be happy while doing it.\n\n\nSocial Life\n\nWe're fundamentally social beings. Put effort into meeting people, make friends, and spend time with them. You don't have to go out doing crazy things all the time, but you should search for people you connect well with.\n\n\n\nIs it easy—or even possible—to maintain all of these pillars all the time? No. But you can at least try. In reality, your priorities are going to swing between some combination of these, and that's ok. But if you're able to tend to these pillars well, the quality of your life becomes dramatically better.\nAcademic Strategy\nPreface/Disclaimer\nIf you're struggling with your core classes, that's completely valid, and it's happened to me as well. In this case, though, most traditional study advice applies, and there's plenty of good stuff on the internet, so I'm not really going to cover that here. If you lose sleep over your GPA, this advice probably isn't going to be very useful quite yet.\nThe \"Advanced\" Academic Strategy\nIf you're not struggling too much in your core classes, these \"advanced\" techniques may be helpful. They're based on Andrej Karpathy's advice:\n\nGetting actual, real-world experience, working on real code base[s], projects or problems outside of silly course exercises is extremely important.\n- Andrej Karpathy\n\nProjects, research, and hands-on work will teach you many things that classes cannot. Unlearn the mentality that GPA is everything—just don't let your GPA stand out in a bad way. Again: chase excellence, not success.\nThat said, you can get a lot out of your classes. Don't avoid the hard classes, and don't avoid a class just because others say that the professor is bad. If you're really interested in a class with a poorly-reputed professor, sit in on it and find out for yourself.\nBut you can't possibly squeeze all the juice out of all your classes. Especially if you want to eat, sleep, and sustain a social life. So how do you decide what to prioritize?\n\nDon't neglect fundamentals. It's tempting to jump into the exciting stuff. Don't let me stop you from doing that—I did the same thing. But don't neglect to also learn the fundamentals. You want to learn the field as deeply as possible—if you think you have an interest in ML, for example, taking fundamental classes (ex. linear algebra, analysis, etc.) will help you figure out if you really like it. The foundations are important, and will help you quickly pick up everything you need when you are self-studying. Personally, bottom-up learning doesn't quite work for me. I like to start with some fundamentals, jump around, and fill in the gaps like a coloring book. However, I do not neglect the fundamentals.\nRelated to the previous point: If you're interested in a specific field (ex. machine learning), take as many relevant classes as you can in that field (ex. matrix analysis, reinforcement learning, optimization, whatever special topics you find).\nFor any class, maximize the insight-effort ratio. Where possible, avoid coursework that is high-effort but low-payoff. Take classes that are low-effort and have a high payoff, or high-effort and have a very high payoff. Recognize that attending lecture has an opportunity cost: That's valuable time you could spend on projects, personal development, and rest. Only attend lectures when there's value in doing so. However, you should assume that your lectures are useful until you have enough evidence to suggest otherwise.\n\nWhile we're on the topic of academic strategies, here are a few other insights:\n\nYou don't actually learn much in lecture. The real learning happens when you do homework and assignments/projects. For this reason, don't do readings just for the sake of it. Use the readings as a reference to help you solve problems in your homework/projects.\nDon't take notes. You get caught up in writing things down, and you don't really try to understand what the professor is talking about. The optimal lecture strategy is to sit back, listen, and try to just understand. You don't need to recall every detail—usually a medium to high-level understanding is enough. You can fill in the details by looking at the slides/internet as needed.\nStudy in the library. Study alone 80% of the time. Study with friends 20% of the time. A dedicated physical space helps you focus. And studying with friends is usually more of a distraction than a helper. But it is sometimes helpful to group study. And it's fun!\n\nGeneral Education (GEs)\nPeople love to treat these classes as a joke and a waste of time. We should value education, not dismiss it. Regardless of what form it comes in. And it's nice to study English, Antarctic climate, or other subjects outside your major—especially when you're going to be taking hardcore technical classes most of the time. And, yes, there's value to \"broadening your thinking.\" It's great to study technology, but technology is a means to an end. Good GEs help you appreciate this fact. You don't want to be that STEM major who only knows how to be technical. GEs teach you how to write and speak clearly, and they teach you how to be critical of the world around you.\nNevertheless, these should be lower-priority courses. Don't spend more time than you have to, but at least learn to appreciate disciplines other than your own. You can get most of the benefits without completing every reading or putting maximal effort into these classes.\nMajor Classes\nThere are three main divisions of major courses:\n\nLower-division: Usually foundational knowledge like mathematics (calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, probability) or programming (object-oriented, basic data structures)\nUpper-division: The meat of your major. These are introductions to various sub-fields in your major (data structures and algorithms, computer architecture, operating systems). I repeat, these are introductory.\nGraduate: These will teach you many things the upper-divisions skipped over. Often more theoretical, specialized, and research/project-oriented.\n\nLower-Division Classes\nGet your lower-division classes out of the way early. Freshman year is when you have the most time and energy. Use that to frontload your coursework. You'll thank yourself later. (I did this and took 5 classes each quarter of my first year. Towards the end, I took just 3 while finishing my degree in 3 years. I spent my last quarter mostly hanging out with friends, and I'm going to have those memories forever. I also learned a lot.)\nFrontloading lower-division courses makes you eligible for internship and research opportunities sooner. While companies will usually prioritze projects and experience over coursework, writing Data Structures and Algorithms (or related classes) on your resume certainly helps tick some checkboxes. This especially helps for that difficult first internship. In school, frontloading also allows you to get to the upper-division and graduate classes quickly.\nBasically, finish these classes as soon as possible so you can be as prepared as possible for anything that comes your way.\n\nAside: everything in CS is math. It's worth paying attention in your math classes. Take extra ones (linear algebra, analysis, abstract algebra, etc.) to build your mathematical maturity.\n\nUpper-Division Classes\nUse the upper-divisions to learn the basics of important sub-fields and figure out what you want to do in your career. Other than data structures + algorithms, UCSB now makes all of its CS classes electives. To me, every CS major still needs to take at least Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, ML or Deep Learning, and Programming Languages or Compilers.\nStart these upper-divisions as soon as possible, even if you don't meet the prerequisites. Ask your academic advisors to let you take the class. If they say no, you can sometimes ask the professor to let you in. Be nice!\nPrerequisites are often a lie—usually intended to ensure academic maturity. But you can get by in a basic machine learning class without deep algorithms knowledge. There will be some gaps, but you can usually fill them on your own. Nuance: If you're taking a class without prerequisites, still make sure you have a baseline level of preparation. You can do this by asking professors/TAs and just doing the coursework. If you avoid letting intimidation scare you away, then it's usually pretty obvious whether or not you are sufficiently prepared. I usually just enrolled in the classes I wanted to take—regardless of prerequisites—then found out pretty quickly whether or not I was prepared.\nIt can be a little intimidating to be the only first or second-year among third and fourth-years. It was for me. This is a good thing, though—upperclassmen will usually have a bit of a better idea of what they're doing than most freshmen. Making upperclassmen friends is awesome. But they don't know everything. It feels like everyone around you always knows what they're doing, but that's usually not the case. Even your advisors and professors don't know everything. Everyone is trying to figure things out. It's okay to be confused and lost. If you put in the effort to learn, then you can do quite well in some of these classes without too much prerequisite knowledge.\nSome classes are a lot of work, so do some load balancing to make sure that you don't take the two heaviest classes in the same quarter. Compilers and Operating Systems are notorious at UCSB for being quite time-consuming. Take them in separate quarters.\nWhen it comes to electives, choose them intentionally. I chose to specialize in ML because I know what I want. If you don't, use these electives to figure out what you might want to specialize in. Once again, if you don't know what you want, your effort should be directed to find out.\nTaking upper-division classes also opens the door to graduate courses...\nGraduate Classes\nIf you're like me, chances are that you've explored topics like reinforcement learning or conversational AI in your free time. Graduate classes are the chance for you to turn these specialized topics into your coursework. If you want rigor and detail (i.e. were disappointed in an undergraduate class), you'll usually get them in a graduate class.\nThere are several types of grad classes, including but not limited to theoretical (ex. preparing for qualifying exams), research, introductions to a special topic, and general seminars. They are all very different, and their difficulty can vary wildly. When choosing a graduate class to take, keep this in mind. What is your motivation for taking the class? Make sure the course's format aligns with your intentions.\n\nThis may not generalize, but in my experience with a few CS graduate courses...\n\nI was intimidated by them at first, but I soon realized that graduate courses are less stressful than undergraduate ones. Grading is more relaxed, so you can focus on learning (excellence, not success). They're often more project-based, with no flurry of exams and deadlines. In these classes, you usually get out what you put in.\nWith graduate courses, however, it's sometimes easy to put in the bare minimum. Sometimes, this is acceptable, especially if you want to spend your time on other projects with a higher insight-effort ratio. But sometimes, you can just get lazy—this is a pitfall to be aware of.\nGraduate classes also have a few other benefits:\n\nYou get to meet graduate students, who have a little better idea of what they're doing than most undergrads. It's the thing with upper-division classes, just upgraded by a level. (But remember that grad students by no means have everything figured out—just ask them.)\nYou also get to know professors more closely, and it's easier to do research with them after taking their class and getting a taste for the field.\nEven if you're not planning to go to graduate school, it's still worthwhile to do a deep dive. Grad classes can be a good way to do this.\n\nDon't just take a grad class for the sake of putting it on your resume/transcript. Nobody really cares about that. Again, focus on excellence and not success. Take the grad classes because they're useful for exploring something you're interested in. (They do, however, also have the side effect of helping with grad school applications if you choose to go that route.)\nIt's nice that you're held to the standards of a grad student in these courses. Nobody's really holding your hand, but professors and classmates will certainly help you if you ask for it. Another nice thing is that—compared to undergrad classes—more people have the maturity to learn for the sake of knowledge. Not just for the sake of finishing their degree.\nExtracurriculars\nOf course, college life comes with a ton of extracurricular activities. I've sorted them into a few buckets: Clubs, research, internships, and noncanonical activities.\nClubs\nAt the start, join a bunch of clubs and narrow them down later. Basically, explore then exploit.\n\nThe rest of this advice is very specific to my experience. It probably does not generalize very well...\n\nYou might want to join the leadership board of a club. Not because it boosts your resume, but because of all the other benefits. If you apply for club leadership just because you want a resume line item, then you will likely be in for a bad time. You have to enjoy it.\nIf you get lucky...\nJoining the board of a club gives you a lot of fulfillment. It's high-impact—you're directly helping out dozens, if not hundreds of students—and it's really good for you socially. The size of my social graph has expanded dramatically by being a club officer. And that's awesome for making friends, close friends, and acquaintances. And as a consequence, it's good for your professional life as well.\nYou also learn a lot by joining the board of a club. Planning events requires patience, and working with other people forces you to become an effective communicator. These are incredibly valuable skills that will serve you in research, internships, and relationships. Especially the communication thing.\nPersonally, I would go so far as to say that joining the board of UCSB's Data Science Club was the single highest-value decision I made throughout all of college due to domino effects like these.\nHowever, finding well-organized clubs like Data Science UCSB is not easy. But at least make an earnest effort to join a club. And if it's the right club, join the board.\nResearch\nEven if you're not planning to go into research or graduate school, it's still useful to try it out. Research teaches you how to learn very effectively, and it's a great way to explore a field in more depth than any class can ever teach you. Professors are, by virtue of holding a PhD, experts in their specific field. Do some research to take advantage of that, and learn from their graduate students as well.\nYou don't have to do anything amazing or ground-breaking. Just try it out. Even if you're just implementing a side project for your PhD student mentor, it might be worth your time. But a lot of undergrad research opportunities can be a waste of time—it takes some self-learning, trial, and error to figure out what projects are worth doing. Eventually you might develop your own taste in research, and at that point you can reach out to a professor or PhD student to advise you on your own idea.\nIt's important to get your fundamental classes out of the way as soon as possible. But in any case, you will have no idea what you are doing at first—and that's okay. Papers are written by domain experts for domain experts, so you need to learn to speak their language by immersing yourself in it. In general, research is hard. And it has a way of constantly humbling you. Remember that.\nInternships\nThere's probably better internship advice out there on the internet, but here are a few miscellaneous notes:\n\nCold apply barely works. I've seen other people have success, but one year I got only around 5 interviews out of 400 cold applications. It's largely a waste of time, but you can win the lottery sometimes.\nI've seen better success from cold-emailing startups. This usually works if you have a reasonably good resume (classes, projects, and research that are relevant to the company's work).\nWork on your resume! Use interview rate as a proxy for how good your resume is. If you're not getting a lot of interviews, then you probably need to keep working on your resume. That's why the first internship is the hardest.\n\nNoncanonical Activities\nThe above are the \"typical\" activities that undergrads do, but don't limit yourself to them. Your action space is larger than you think. Learn a new language, or a new instrument, make pottery, or just go outside and touch grass. Touching grass is highly underrated (is it?)\nAt the end of the day, you're a human. Not a machine. It's easy to forget, but your work is just one part of your life. Having a social life, learning how to communicate and have emotional maturity, and going outside make you a better person. A life well lived includes all of the above. If you only learned how to min-max your academics in college, you've largely wasted your time.\nConclusion\nMy advice throughout this post has been mostly academic, but there's so much more to college than academics. It's simply impossible to write a comprehensive guide to everything in college—academics are probably the easiest piece to write a guide for. But I think Rancho's advice applies to more than just studying: If you focus on becoming an excellent person—whatever that means—success will naturally run after you.\nOther Good Advice\nA few other good advice posts I've personally bookmarked:\n\nAdvice to Young People, The Lies I Tell Myself\nAndrej Karpathy's Advice\n\n\nAnd a huge thanks to my friend Dan for a ton of feedback!

The company's constant litigation threats show how money really is power.\n\n\n\nAmerican Kingpin - Nick Bilton\n\nStory of the rise + fall of the Silk Road. Compelling storytelling, going deep into the backstories of its founder (Ross Ulbricht), friends and family, co-conspirators, everyday people, and FBI/DEA investigators. Also a very strong example of how money and power easily corrupts even seemingly innocent people.\n\n\nThe Diary of a Young Girl - Anne Frank\n\nMan's Search for Meaning - Viktor E. Frankl\n\nThe first ~50% was focused on his experiences in concentration camps. The rest was spent on explaining logotherapy—a psychological school of thought focused on finding meaning. I was expecting the two subjects to be blended into a normal memoir, so this wasn't what I expected. Worthwhile read!\n\n\n\nBorn a Crime - Trevor Noah\n\nI Am Malala - Malala Yousafzai\n\nSteve Jobs - Walter Isaacson\n\nWhen Breath Becomes Air - Paul Kalanithi\n\nA short but very meaningful read. \"As a resident, my highest ideal was not saving lives—everyone dies eventually—but guiding a patient or family to an understanding of death or illness.\"\n\n\n\nScience, Math, and Philosophy\n\nMeditations - Marcus Aurelius\nGödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid - Douglas R. Hofstadter\nSapiens - Yuval Noah Harari\n\nThe Stranger - Albert Camus\n\nI find the idea of absurdism very interesting, and this book gets a lot of praise. But personally I just couldn't appreciate this novel that much.\n\n\nA Short History of Nearly Everything -&nbsp;Bill Bryson\nA Brief History of Time&nbsp;–&nbsp;Stephen Hawking\nHow to Change Your Mind - Michael Pollan\nGeneral Relativity - Leonard Susskind\nHow to Avoid a Climate Disaster - Bill Gates\nWhy We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams - Matthew Walker\nWalden - Henry David Thoreau\nThe Heart of the Buddha's Teaching - Thich Nhat Hanh\nHow to Love - Thich Nhat Hanh\n\n21 Lessons for the 21st Century - Yuval Noah Harari\n\nPermanent Record - Edward Snowden\n\nI recommend this to basically everybody. Highlights the massive danger companies and governments create by disrespecting people's privacy. Reminded me to pursue a responsible career in tech.\n\n\n\nSelf-Help\nFinance/Career\n\nThe Intelligent Investor - Benjamin Graham\n\nThe Richest Man in Babylon - George Clason\n\nOften described as timeless advice, this book gives financial principles to live by (guard your hard-earned money, put money to work for you). Most of the advice seems applicable today, but some feels a bit archaic.\n\n\n\nI Will Teach You to Be Rich - Ramit Sethi\n\nMuch more modern and timely advice: Get the big things right and don't stress so much about the small ones. I enjoy his focus on the idea of a \"rich life\"—one where you can \"spend lavishly on things you really enjoy, but cut back mercilessly on other things.\" If I had to recommend one book on personal finance, it'd be this one.\n\n\n\nOther\n\nThe Power of Habit - Charles Duhigg\nLike a Virgin - Richard Branson\n\nAtomic Habits - James Clear\n\nUpdated opinion: The techniques are useful, but this book could've been a blog post. Like many self-help books, the bulk of the text contains fluffy anecdotes and (occasionally) bad science.\nPrevious opinion: Overall good book. Forcing yourself to build/break habits is like swimming upstream. This book focuses on techniques that are more pleasant and effective. I still successfully use some of the principles from this book (tracked cycling progress encouraged me to go out more, keeping a water bottle with me made drinking more water effortless).\n\n\n\nSpark Joy - Marie Kondo\n\nThe Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up - Marie Kondo\n\nThis book was more of a guide to tidying—folding clothes, packing bags, etc. Both books were a good reminder to be intentional about the things I do/keep.\n\n\n\nCookbooks\n\nFlour Water Salt Yeast - Ken Forkish\n\nThe Wok - J. Kenji Lopez-Alt\n\nAmazing cookbook that answers the why of cooking more so than the how. I've used his principles to make excellent stir-fried noodles and tofu, among other things. Significantly boosted my cooking confidence.\n\n\nThe Food Lab - J. Kenji Lopez-Alt\nSalt, Fat, Acid, Heat - Samin Nosrat\nOn Food and Cooking - Harold McGee\n\nFiction\n\nThe Lord of the Rings - J.R.R. Tolkein\nFoundation - Isaac Asimov\nI, Robot - Isaac Asimov\nStranger in a Strange Land - Robert Heinlein\nSlaughterhouse Five - Kurt Vonnegut\nCat's Cradle - Kurt Vonnegut\nThe Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas - Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis\n1984 - George Orwell\nThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy - Douglas Adams (DNF)\nThe Count of Monte Cristo - Alexandre Dumas\n\nFinished it a long time ago, DNFed while re-reading recently.\n\n\nThe Kite Runner - Khaled Hosseini\n\nThe Three Body Problem - Cixin Liu\n\nOk. The plot is quite interesting (especially towards the end), and I love heavy doses of science in my sci-fi. But the science sometimes felt absurd here, and the pacing/development of the story also didn't feel right.\n\n\nExhalation –&nbsp;Ted Chiang\nDon Quixote - Miguel De Cervantes Saavedra\n\nStories of Your Life and Others - Ted Chiang\n\nA Thousand Splendid Suns - Khaled Hosseini\n\nBeautifully written story with complex characters. Also one of my favorite books of all time.\n\n\n\nThe Martian - Andy Weir\n\nProject Hail Mary - Andy Weir\n\nOne of the best books I've read - just as good as—if not better than—The Martian. Amazing characters and scientific detail, just like his first novel.\n\n\n\nNorwegian Wood - Haruki Murakami\n\nI enjoyed how artfully Murakami sets mundane scenes, but some poorly developed characters really broke the book for me.\n\n\n\nSiddhartha - Hermann Hesse\n\n","id":"https://tanaybiradar.com/blog/antilibrary/","title":"The Antilibrary"},"https://tanaybiradar.com/blog/blog-like-its-1999/":{"body":"This website was proudly built with HTML + CSS (and two small scripts).\nI had spent months thinking about renovating my blog.

Now, what on earth should I do?\"\nThe description of this article was somewhat a lie: In reality, both execution\nand ideation are extremely hard (or are they?). So many of us—including me—have\ndecided to start a project out of the blue, spending hours considering possible\nproblems to solve and whether or not an adequate solution already exists. The\nproject, naturally, ends in frustration and with nothing to show in the end.\nWhen starting on a project, the most important element is an organic idea.\nRegardless of how genius or foolish the idea is, I have found that the most\nenjoyable, interesting, and impressive projects stem from organic ideas.\n\"Great, so what exactly is an organic idea?\"\nThe best ideas are ones that come \"out of the blue,\" that is, ideas that are not\nforced by a brainstorming session or hours of sitting in front of an empty\ndocument and whiteboard. According to Barbara Oakley, an engineering professor at\nOakland University and a meta-learning educator, when the brain is not focused\nintently on a particular task, it \"enters into a natural default mode of diffuse\nthinking\" 1. In this state, the brain is free to generate new ideas by\nconnecting previously acquired knowledge and observations.\nMost of us are already familiar with this state: we know that studying a unit's\nmaterial the night before an exam is not conducive to scoring well, and we also\nknow that being repeatedly exposed to information—say, words in a foreign\nlanguage—is an excellent way to learn. In fact, jadeocr\nleverages a similar effect.\nJadeocr illustrates the importance of organic thinking in two ways: The app\nencourages the mind to naturally develop a vocabulary base through the\naforementioned spaced-repetition,\ntechnique, allowing users to slowly acquire foreign language vocabulary\nwhile giving enough time between review sessions to allow the brain to engage\nits diffuse mode. Additionally, jadeocr itself was a product of organic thinking.\nThe idea for jadeocr came to me during my fourth-period Mandarin class in my\nsophomore year—notably, it was not the result of any brainstorming session.\nI was simply sitting at my desk, practicing writing a handful of simplified\ncharacters to prepare for a coming vocabulary quiz. I wasn't worried about scoring\nwell on that particular quiz, but I wanted to earn a perfect score on\nthe upcoming midterm exam, and the only thing holding me back was a few writing\nmistakes.\nAs an aside, writing Chinese characters requires some attention to\ndetail; some notorious examples are 末/未, 复/夏, 换/挽, 口/囗. The last one,\nto be fair, has a radical,\nbut my point still stands.\nAs I started to search for apps that could help me prepare for the next midterm\nexam, I realized that each of them had some shortcomings that I was not willing\nto deal with. Eventually, I came to terms with the fact that no existing app\nsatisfied my needs, so I set out on building my own with some help from a friend.\nThe idea was organic, and as a result I was genuinely passionate about the project:\nI didn't mind working on it for eight or more hours per day during my summer\nbreak, and the result of my work was a product that I was proud of. Moreover,\nI was willing to build it again—nearly\nfrom scratch—to improve my code quality, add more features, and share it with\nmore people.\nWe all generate ideas this way: We all have those points where we think, \"if\nthis existed, my life would be so much easier.\" The two most difficult parts of\nbringing these ideas to fruition are capturing the idea and getting started. \nCapturing ideas—taking note of them when they occur—consists of two primary\nsteps: Recognizing the idea and capturing it. Recognizing ideas takes practice;\nthe next time an idea comes to mind—the next time you wish \"I wish this existed\"\nor the next time you think \"it would be cool if this was a thing\"—make a mental\nnote of that idea. Thoughts are ephemeral, however, so an even better idea is\nto make either a physical or digital note.\nWith ideas in hand, the hardest step is now getting started. Everything else\nwill fall into place after a project has started: Specifications, technologies,\nand design can all more or less figure themselves out without too much effort.\nThis doesn't mean building a project doesn't require significant amounts of\ntime and effort—it does. However, with an organic idea, the passion required\nto drive a project forward is often self-sustaining.\n\n1\nA Mind for Numbers.\n\n","id":"https://tanaybiradar.com/blog/capitalizing-on-ideas/","title":"Capitalizing on ideas"},"https://tanaybiradar.com/blog/cherrypicked-thoughts-from-a-summer-harvest/":{"body":"here are some selected thoughts, chat excerpts, and tweets from a summer's\nworth of introspection. based on what's relevant to me; not much nuance.\n1. giving up?\n\nsometimes i walk up to a boulder in the gym.\ni don't know if i'm capable of sending it.\ni try and fall. over. and over. and over.\nsometimes i triumph.\nother days, the gym takes down the problem to make way for another one.\nother days, i stare and tell myself, \"nope, not today.\"\nand then i walk away.\ni'd like to say i gave it my all. but i don't always do that.\nis that ok? does that say something bad about me?\nbut i guess it's just some plastic on a wall.\n\n2. ranchoddas pt. 1\ncontext:\n\nkabil hone ke liye padho. success ke piche mat bhago.\nexcellence, excellence ka picha karo. success tumhare jhak maar ke peeche aayegi.\n\"study for the sake of becoming more capable. don't run after success. excellence, excellence\nis what you should chase. success will easily come after you.\" \n- ranchoddas chanchad, 3 idiots (clip)\n\ni need to remind myself of this scene more; maybe i should make a poster of it.\ntweet by Raj Dabre\n\ni chose to do my phd.\ni was 24 years old and unhappy.\ni did my phd at kyoto university.\nalways dreamed of working at big tech.\ncouldn't get in.\ni was 28 and unhappy.\nsettled for my current work place with mediocre salary.\nno one expected anything from me and let me do whatever i wanted.\nexperienced explosive growth.\nextremely happy.\nlesson: forget big titles and salaries and contentment will follow.\nfunnily enough, i got multiple promotions leading to a decent salary.\nit's like ranchordas said: excellence and not success. do what you love.\n\n3. ranchoddas pt. 2\ni got into tech because i love it; beyond a certain point, fulfillment/happiness\nbecomes a higher priority than money. i'm lucky that the field i love (mostly) pays\nenough for me to live comfortably, so i (should) have the freedom to pick whatever job i want.\nbut i sometimes have a (sort of irrational) worry that i won't be able to find a\njob.\ni sent this one in a group chat a few days ago:\n\ntoday i was talking to a coworker who came from burma in the early 2000s\nand he was just like\n\"yeah dont worry about the money, the money will come if u go after ur skills\"\n\"also worst case scenario u can just live with your parents\"\n\"i didn't have that option.\"\n\"if i didn't get a job i couldn't just go back to burma. i'd be homeless\"\nhe's so right\n\n4. quit bad everything\ntweet by Anu Atluru\n\nquit bad everything — bad food, bad books, bad jobs, bad people — otherwise they become bad habits and suddenly you’re living a bad life\n\n5. pendulum\ninspiration/source - Tim Dessaint\nwork-life balance is not a scale, it's a pendulum. we can swing back and forth between periods of heavy emphasis on work, and heavy emphasis on life. don't underestimate the power of intensity.\nbut it has to be something you enjoy.\n(kind of like a barbell strategy)\n","id":"https://tanaybiradar.com/blog/cherrypicked-thoughts-from-a-summer-harvest/","title":"cherrypicked thoughts from a summer harvest"},"https://tanaybiradar.com/blog/deploying-a-full-stack-application/":{"body":"Between lines of code and a website lies the world of\nDevOps: \"Development Operations.\"\nArguably, DevOps is the most overlooked—and challenging—parts of the software\ndevelopment lifecycle. Nevertheless, it is still an equally crucial process, and\nit involves everything from version control to build to deployment and scaling.\nThe DevOps cycle is not separate from the code: It is a part of the code.\nFor jadeocr, we used Git for our version control\nsystem and GitHub as our remote repository and\nproject management hub. The platform is where we keep track of issues and manage\ncollaborating on code. We also use GitHub as part of our\nCI/CD pipeline\nto automatically build the website and server and make the changes live on the\nwebsite.\nPushing code to the master branch of our GitHub repository triggers numerous\nGitHub workflows that comprise our CI/CD process. GitHub first sends a ping\nacross the web—an HTTP POST\nrequest—to our server. After receiving the request from GitHub, a continuous deployment\nserver written in Node.js—previously in Golang—quickly goes to work, pulling\nthe latest code from the GitHub master branch and uses\nDocker Compose to build and start the\napplication containers,\nwhich are isolated environments called in which application code can run. The\nserver simply executes a series of shell commands after it receives a request\nat a particular API endpoint; from a\ntechnical perspective, therefore, this system is quite simple.\nAfterward, a GitHub action builds the jadeocr-next client and the server into\ntheir respective Docker images and publishes them to the\nGitHub Container Registry.\nThese containers solve the common issue of \"it works on my machine\" and make\nbuilding, deploying, and scaling applications with\nKubernetes relatively straightforward\n1. Although I faced several (frustrating) hurdles while writing the\ninitial configuration files for these Docker containers, managing them after\nthe initial setup process has been a breeze.\nPerhaps the most complex individual cog in this software\ndevelopment machine is Nginx (Engine-X)\nserver and reverse proxy. Nginx is simply a web server, but it can also function\nas a reverse proxy\nto direct web traffic to its intended destination. We use Nginx in two places:\nin front of the website's static files and in front of the entire website.\nWhen we build the website files into the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that the\nbrowser renders after loading jadeocr-next, our web\nframework's build tool, Vue CLI, creates a directory\nof static files that must be served by a web server. Therefore, we use Nginx in\nfront of the client to serve these static files. We then use another Nginx\nserver in our cloud virtual machine to direct API requests to our web server\nand website requests to the aforementioned client Nginx server. \nAlthough each system is fairly simple on its own, the confluence of all these\ntools in a single pipeline creates many moving parts which are challenging—but\nfun—to manage. Perhaps such a DevOps system is overkill for such a small\napplication, but it provides jadeocr-next with the ability to easily scale and\navoid future errors. Most importantly, however, going through this DevOps\njourney has been a valuable and fulfilling experience for me—even if I do\nsometimes spend multiple days staring at a terminal window in confusion.\n:wq\n\n1\nFor now, we are running jadeocr-next on a virtual private server (VPS),\nbut we do plan to deploy a Kubernetes cluster in the future.\n\n","id":"https://tanaybiradar.com/blog/deploying-a-full-stack-application/","title":"Deploying a full-stack web application"},"https://tanaybiradar.com/blog/dont-waste-your-life/":{"body":"A friend recently asked me, \"Do you have a guiding principle for your life?\"\nIt's hard to pick one thing that I believe in as my North Star. But after a little thinking, I settled on this one: Don't waste your life.\nA life well lived is one that is not wasted. Which means that there are many wrong ways to live your life, but also plenty of right ones. For instance:\n\nOpen a cafe, raise a goose, and fly planes\nBecome an engineer working on Important Problems\nBe a great parent and a great friend\nBe a teacher, mentor, or educator\nIdeally, do some combination of the above\n\nWhen I think of a life not wasted, I think about constantly trying to become an excellent person—whatever that means. I think of experimenting with silly ideas and building things. I think of taking care of the people around me and doing \"good\" (defined in some reasonable way) for other people. I think of continuously learning something and doing Hard Things from time to time. Notably, I do not think of getting an absurdly high-paying job or becoming the world's best at something.\nIt's so easy to live on autopilot and go through years of your life—only to realize that you haven't done the things you actually want to. The action space of your life is huge, but your actions tend to converge around whatever your peers do. So you're artificially constraining yourself to a subset of the action space.\n\n    \n\nSo, to start exploring, we need to ask ourselves questions like:\n\n\"What would you do right now if you didn't have to worry about money, time, or what others thought about you?\"\n\"What would you do/try/or experiment with if you knew you couldn't fail?\"\n\"What would you do/try/experiment with even if you knew that you would fail?\"\n\nWhat are your responses? They might surprise you.\nMaybe you want to quit your job and start a cafe. Work abroad for a few months while building a startup. Go to grad school and become a teaching professor.

In contrast, loose feedback loops are the reason some things feel incredibly difficult:\n\nApplying to jobs, internships, or basically anything else. Rejections pile up with little explanation.

Convert it into a vector space!\nOne Hot Encoding\nIf the size of our vocabulary is $|V|$, then we can represent each word as a $|V|$-dimensional vector with a 1 in one location and a 0 everywhere else. This is the one-\"hot\" approach.\n\n$$\n\\vec{v_\\text{twelve}} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\n\\end{bmatrix}^T\n$$\n\nAlthough it converts words/sentences into a computer friendly format, there are at least two big issues. Can you guess what they are?\n\nLarge vocabularies will result in unnecessarily massive and sparse vectors\nBecause the vectors are so sparse, we don't get any inherent notion of semantics or relationships between words (all words are orthogonal to each other in the vector space)\n\nSo the one-hot approach is bad. Let's try something else!\nTF-IDF\nStands for \"Term Frequency, Inverse Document Frequency.\" This approach gives us an idea of how important a word is in any document, using a numerical weight.\nTerm frequency is calculated by finding the proportion of times the term (word/token) shows up in the document. If $t$ is the term, $d$ is the document, and $f$ is the frequency, then we calculate it with:\n\n$$\n\\text{tf}(t, d) = \\frac{f_{t, d}}{\\sum_{t^\\prime \\in d} f_{t^\\prime, d}}\n$$\n\nInverse document frequency is calculated by dividing the total number of documents by the number of documents that contain the term $t$. We throw a logarithm in there, too. Here, $N$ is the number of documents and $D$ is the set of all documents. We add a $1$ on the numerator and denominator to avoid dividing by zero.\n\n$$ \\text{idf}(t, d) = \\log \\frac{N + 1}{|\\\\{ d \\in D \\vert t \\in d \\\\}| + 1}$$\n\nWe can then multiply the two values together to get a single TF-IDF score:\n\n$$\n\\text{tf-idf}(t, d, D) = \\text{tf}(t, d) \\cdot \\text{idf}(t, d)\n$$\n\nWe can find how \"important\" certain words are in any given document by seeing how high their TF-IDF scores are. Intuitively, a high TF-IDF score means that a word shows up in few documents, but in a particular document $d$ it shows up frequently. Thus, it is likely to carry important information.\nWords like a, an, the are likely to be filtered out because they are likely to show up within many documents (even though they may show up often inside these documents).\nCreating Vectors: How do we create a vector from this information? For each term, we can just create a $|D|$-dimensional vector, where the $d$th index is the TF-IDF score $\\text{tf-idf}(t, d, D)$ for the word $t$ in document $d$.\nTF-IDF only does an OK job at capturing the semantic meanings and relationships between words. With a lot of documents, even the TF-IDF vectors can be sparse. However, this approach does better than one hot encoding, and it also captures how important each word is! Luckily, we can do better.\nWord2Vec (CBOW &amp; Skip-Gram)\nOf course, people have thought of using neural networks to solve the embeddings problem. Word2Vec is a family of models that use does exactly this.\nWord2Vec is an unsupervised classification algorithm. We want to find the probabilities of other surrounding words in the vocabulary. (Therefore, we use a softmax activation in the final layer and cross-entropy loss while training.)\nOur goal is to perform Maximum Likelihood Estimation. We're training our Word2Vec model on a corpus of data. We want to choose our neural network's parameters such that the model maximizes the probability of related words showing up together.\nLet's clarify what that means. There are two approaches, CBOW and Skip-Gram.\n\n(The below is also taken from Boykis's Embeddings book)\n(Semantle is a fun Wordle spin-off based on Word2Vec)\n\nContinuous Bag of Words (CBOW)\nWe have a context window of fixed size, and we want to find the probabilities of the word in the blank.\nWe can use a simple MLP-style architecture (a fully connected layer with a linear classifier on top), and we can just grab the vectors from the hidden layer. We \"create one-hot encodings of each word to a numerical position, and each position back to a word, so that we can easily reference both our words and vectors. The goal is to be able to map back and forth when we do lookups and retrieval.\" (Boykis)\nSkip-Gram\nIn skip-gram, we predict all the words surrounding our input within the context window.\nWe assume that words that show up together have similar meanings (distributional hypothesis). Our goal is to push these similar words (vectors) closer together in the vector space.\nIn our skip-gram implementation, we use a one-hot encoding as the input to our neural network (source).\nIf you're interested in learning more, read about negative sampling, which helps train more efficiently on larger vocabularies.\nLinear Algebra, A Detour\nCurse of Dimensionality, Reduction via PCA\nWhen we have high-dimensional vectors in machine learning, we often want to reduce their dimensionality while still preserving as much important information as we can.\n\nOnce we start generating a large number of features (columns), we start\nrunning into the curse of dimensionality....\nThe more features we accumulate, the more data we need in order to accurately statistically confidently say anything about them, which results in models that may not accurately represent our data\n(Boykis)\n\nPrincipal Component Analysis\nYou might want to review What is an eigenvalue/eigenvector? (3Blue1Brown)\n\nSort eigenvectors of covariance matrix by eigenvalue (large $\\rightarrow$ small)\nPick top $k$ eigenvectors as principal components\nProject vectors onto principal components\n\nThe idea here is that we're translating our data into a new basis determined by the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. By doing so, we pick the directions that best capture the variance in the data.\nIn-depth notes for the curious:\nThe covariance matrix $\\Sigma$ is a special type of matrix called a Hermitian matrix—meaning it's equal to its own (conjugate) transpose. In other words, $\\text{cov}(X, Y) = \\text{cov}(Y, X)$\nA property of such matrices is that the eigenvectors form a basis for their domain/range. Thus we can write any vector in the domain of the covariance matrix as a linear combination of the eigenvectors. The eigenvectors will also be orthogonal because the covariance matrix is Hermitian.\nWhen we perform PCA, we are changing the basis of our data into a new basis defined by the eigenvectors of $\\Sigma$.\n\nWhat’s&nbsp;special about this basis is it redefines your components to have zero linear dependence (in the variance of your data). That is, each eigenvector controls one and only one dimension of linear randomness. And the amount of randomness is given by your eigenvalue, which is the variance along that axis.\n- Daniel Naylor\n\nEmbedding Similarity Metrics\nSince we've embed our natural language into a vector space, we can now perform all sorts of vector math on them!\nOne of the most useful things to do is compute distances between various embeddings (which represent words/sentences/etc.).\nThere are all sorts of metrics between a pair of two-vectors $\\vec{x}, \\vec{y}$:\n\nManhattan Distance (L1): $\\text{dist}(\\vec{x}, \\vec{y}) = |x_1 - y_1| + |x_2 - y_2|$\nEuclidean Distance (L2): $\\text{dist}(\\vec{x}, \\vec{y}) = ((x_1 - y_1)^2 + (x_2 - y_2)^2)^\\frac{1}{2}$\nCosine Similarity: $\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\vec{x} \\cdot \\vec{y}}{||\\vec{x}||||\\vec{y}||}$\n\nWe like to use cosine similarity in NLP to compare embeddings, because our vectors might be high-dimensional and have high Euclidean distances from each other. It's useful to call two vectors similar when they are close to parallel with each other.\nNOTE: Cosine similarity is not a true distance metric (violates the triangle inequality), but it's still a useful metric.\nVector Databases: The Power of Embeddings\nSemantic search allows you to search for content based on its meaning, rather than just matching keywords or doing a regular-expression search.\n\nExample Project (shameless self-promotion)\n\nLanguage Models &amp; Conditional Probability\n\nThis section adapted from Harvard CS197 Lecture Notes\n\nLanguage models are just models that estimate a probability distribution of words, conditioned on a sequence of previous words (technically, tokens, which can be words but also other things like contractions or punctuation).\nIn this very simple example, our model outputs these probabilities:\n\n$$P(\\text{sleep} | \\text{I'm really tired, I'm going to}) = 0.8$$\n$$P(\\text{study} | \\text{I'm really tired, I'm going to}) = 0.2$$\n\nWe have a similar process for sequence-to-sequence generation. If we pick the most likely word from above:\n\n$$P(\\text{soon} | \\text{I'm really tired, I'm going to sleep}) = 0.75$$\n$$P(\\text{today} | \\text{I'm really tired, I'm going to sleep}) = 0.1$$\n$$P(\\text{tonight} | \\text{I'm really tired, I'm going to sleep}) = 0.15$$\n\nSo then by simple probability rules,\n\n$$\nP(\\text{I'm really tired, I'm going to sleep soon} | \\text{I'm really tired, I'm going to}) = 0.8 \\times 0.75 = 0.6\n$$\n\n","id":"https://tanaybiradar.com/blog/intro-to-nlp-embeddings/","title":"Notes: Embeddings in NLP"},"https://tanaybiradar.com/blog/large-language-models-are-not-intelligent/":{"body":"\nUpdate - 2024/09/16\nMy take in this post is somewhat pessimistic. As time has\ngone by, I'm a bit more excited about the ability of LLMs to\nsynthesize novel knowledge. Andrej Karpathy has some positive views in\nthis podcast, and this blog post by Nicholas Carlini\nhas a good neutral-ish (also somewhat optimistic) view.\n\nI've found myself using LLMs less and less over time. They're great for generating summaries, rephrasing writing, explaining concepts, and writing some code—things I refer to as \"manual labor.\" But if you ask them to do anything reasoning-heavy, they fail very often.\nToday's LLMs are not actually intelligent; they're just really good stochastic parrots.\nMemorization is a big deal\nAbout 4 months ago, I read a paper titled Scalable Extraction of Training Data from (Production) Language Models. That was when I realized memorization is a powerful tool for LLM performance.\n\nAside (for context): DeepMind previously found laws governing the optimal model size/number of training tokens under a fixed FLOPS budget. Popular models, such as LLaMA-7B and Mistral-7B may be trained with few parameters—but they're overtrained compared to these Chinchilla-optimal token counts. LLaMA3, for instance, was pretrained on over 15 trillion tokens.\n\nWhen attacking both closed LLMs (like GPT-3.5-instruct) and semi-closed models (such as LLaMA), the authors found a significant relationship between overtraining and memorization. Nearly 0.30% of LLaMA-7B's generated tokens were memorized. And nearly 0.80% of LLaMA-65B's generated tokens were memorized! Meanwhile, around 0.50% of Mistral-7B's generated tokens were memorized.\nAnd these are lower bounds!\nOn the other hand, undertrained models such as OPT-1.3B and OPT-6.7B had much lower memorization rates (around 0.03% and 0.09%, respectively).\nThe percentages may seem small, but the results indicate that language models regularly spit out memorized training data. And memorization rates of 0.30%-0.80% in the overtrained models are nontrivial.\nWhat do benchmarks even measure?\nIt's probably not a coincidence that these overtrained, memorizing models are exactly the ones that perform well on popular benchmarks. For instance, LLaMA-65B and Mistral-7B score significantly higher on the MMLU benchmark compared to the undertrained OPT-66B.\nThe TinyLlama project provides some more evidence for this hypothesis. They overtrained a 1.1-billion parameter model with 3 trillion tokens. All else held constant, the Commonsense benchmark scores increase approximately linearly with the number of training tokens.\nThis relationship between overtraining and benchmarks leads me to wonder: What do benchmarks even measure? We use benchmark scores as a proxy for knowledge, reasoning, and intelligence. But are they really measuring those abilities? Or are they measuring memorization? Memorization isn't intelligence—and if the pretraining dataset may be contaminated by benchmark data, these benchmark scores tell us even less about the intelligence of our LLMs.\nIt's all about the data\nAbout a week ago, I read a little post titled The “it” in AI models is the dataset. And that got me thinking...there's a reason Meta, Mistral, and other companies that release \"open\" models don't release their training data.\nThis paper from Meta uses controlled studies to really show how much training data matters.  Successfully fine-tuning a LLM on question-answering tasks depends highly on data augmentation: One of the paper's experiments shows a 9.7% knowledge extraction accuracy without augmentation, but a 96.6% accuracy with data augmentation.\nWhy? If the model hasn't seen a question phrased in a particular way during training, it'll probably perform worse on that question during generation. Augmentation gives the LLM a higher diversity of data, so that no matter how a user phrases a question, the model is more likely to have seen that phrasing before. (In other words, in-distribution performance is much better than out-of-distribution performance.)\nAgain—this research suggests memorization, not intelligence.\nLimitations on Reasoning\nI've repeatedly mentioned that memorization and intelligence are not the same. But is that really the case? The answer is yes: Even if an LLM \"memorizes\" a fact, it cannot reliably answer basic reasoning questions about that fact.\nIf a model sees the sentence, \"BTS's debut song is titled 'No More Dream,'\" it likely won't be able to answer the question, \"What artist debuted with the song 'No More Dream'?\" LLMs struggle with this kind of task, called inverse search.\nAnd LLMs cannot reliably answer comparison questions, either. From the Meta paper:\n\nDetermining whether a month is even or odd requires 10,000 training samples to achieve a 75% accuracy, despite theoretically needing a sample complexity on the order of O(12).\nRanking months [such as indicating that April comes before July] requires 50,000 training samples to reach an 85% test accuracy, even with a theoretical sample complexity of O(122), provided no hint is given.\n\nSurprisingly, this holds regardless of finetuning, prompting, or pretraining.\nAll this is bad news if we expect today's LLMs to genuinely become intelligent.\nBut if you're just trying to quickly write some code to generate Matplotlib figures, things have never been better.\n","id":"https://tanaybiradar.com/blog/large-language-models-are-not-intelligent/","title":"LLMs are not intelligent"},"https://tanaybiradar.com/blog/lqr-mdp/":{"body":"\nI'm currently taking an introduction to robot learning class, and I got a little confused by this derivation. These are some notes I made while attempting to understand it better. Note that this won't be like some of my explainer blog posts.\nReference material is thanks to the Winter 2025 CS291I lecture notes from Prof. James Preiss at UC Santa Barbara. None of these insights or formulas are my own. I am just rehashing them into a way that I understand well.\n\nBackground\nWe will first refresh ourselves with the standard formulation of Markov Decision Processes: Given an MDP $\\mathcal{M} = (\\mathcal{S}, \\mathcal{A}, c, P, \\mu_0)$, we want to find the optimal policy $\\pi^\\star$ that minimizes cost—or identically, maximizes reward.\nWe will focus on minimizing cost in this example.\n\n$\\mathcal{S}$: The state space\n$\\mathcal{A}$: The action space\n$P$: The transition probability function (the dynamics)\n$c$: The cost function tells us the immediate reward (identically, reward) received when taking an action in a state\n$\\mu_0$: The initial state distribution\n\nFirst, remember that the value function $V^\\pi$ maps states to actions ($V^\\pi: \\mathcal{S}\\mapsto\\mathcal{A}$). The value function gives the expected cost (throughout the trajectory/episode) if you always act according to your policy $\\pi$ after starting at a state $s$.\nThe exact formula for the value function depends on the setting. As an example, in the infinite-horizon discounted setting:\n$$V^\\pi(s) = \\mathbb{E}_{a \\sim \\pi(\\cdot | s)} \\left[ c(s,a) + \\gamma \\mathbb{E} \\left[V^\\pi(s')\\right] \\right] \\tag{1}$$\n\nFor some reason the markdown renderer isn't working properly. In that equation, the inner expectation is intended to be $\\mathbb{E}_{s' \\sim P(\\cdot | s, a)}$.\n\nIf we break the above equation down, we:\n\nSample an action according to our policy ($a \\sim \\pi(\\cdot | s)$)\nTransition to the next state $s'$ according to the transition probability ($s' \\sim P(\\cdot | s, a)$)\nThen we recursively get the expected value from the next state ($V^\\pi(s')$)\n\nNext, we have the optimal value function $V^\\star$. In any state, $V^\\star(s)$ gives the best possible value (lowest expected cost) that any policy could have had in state $s$. Formally, \n$$V^\\star(s) = \\min_\\pi V^{\\pi} \\tag{2}$$\nWe can find the optimal policy $\\pi^\\star$ (the one that minimizes expected future cost) by first computing $V^\\star$ and then \"acting greedily\" according to $V^\\star$.\n$$\\pi^\\star = \\arg\\min_a c(s,a) + \\gamma\\mathbb{E}_{s' \\sim P(\\cdot | s, a)} \\left[V^\\star(s')\\right] \\tag{3}$$\nProblem Statement\nIf it's easy to find $\\pi^\\star$ policy once we have $V^\\star$, then the question is: how do we find the optimal value function $V^\\star$ for the MDP?\nFor MDPs with discrete state spaces, we can use algorithms like value iteration to find $V^\\star$.\nBut what if we have a continuous state space (like in a robotics application)? In that case, we can't hope to tabulate $V^\\star(s)$ when there are an uncountably infinite possibilities for $s \\in \\mathcal{S}$.\nIn one case, however, the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) MDP, we have a nice way to compute the optimal value function. We'll understand the method for computing $V^\\star(s)$ in the finite-horizon, discrete-time case.\nSetup: $V^\\star$ in the LQR MDP\nFirst, let's define the deterministic state transition dynamics and the cost function:\n$$\ns_{t+1} = As_t + Ba_t\n\\quad\nc(s, a) = s^TQs + a^TRa\n\\tag{4}\n$$\nWe also are given that $Q$ and $R$ are positive-semi-definite (PSD).\nNote: Time-Dependent Value Functions\nUnlike the infinite-horizon setting, the optimal value function in the finite-horizon setting depends on time. So we can't use the same infinite-horizon value function in equation $(1)$.\nWhy? Here's an example: In the infinite-horizon setting, we'd just keep transitioning to $s_1$ in order to minimize cost. But in the finite-horizon case, we'd transition to $s_2$ at the very last time step.\n\n    \n\nLQR Value Function\nWe can formulate our value function for this LQR by modifying $(1)$. Here the policy is deterministic, and so are the state transitions. Then, with $a = \\pi(s)$ and $s' = P(s, a)$,\n$$V_{t+1}^\\pi(s) = c(s,a) + V_t^\\pi(s')\\tag{5}$$\n$$V_{t+1}^\\star(s) = \\min_a \\left[ c(s,a) + V_t^\\star(s') \\right] \\tag{6}$$\nSince we're in a finite-horizon setting, we also got rid of the discount factor $\\gamma$. Remember that $V^\\star$ also depends on time, so we'll denote $V_t^\\pi$ for time $t$.\nDynamic Programming: Method for Computing $V^\\star$ in the LQR MDP\nWe can now compute $V^\\star$ in an inductive, dynamic-programming manner.\nThis is our plan:\n\nBase Case: Compute $V_H^\\star$ (optimal value funciton at the final timestep $H$)\nInductive Step: Given $V_{t+1}^\\star$, we want to get $V_h^\\star$. In other words, work backwards to derive $V^\\star$ in previous timesteps. \n\n\n    \n\nBase Case\nIn the final timestep $t=H$, we know that $c(s, a) = s^TQs + a^TRa$. But since we're in the final timestep, there is no action to be taken, so $a=0$. Thus,\n$$\nV_H^\\star(s) = s^TQs\n$$\n(Since $Q$ is PSD, this value function is non-negative—which passes the sanity check.)\nInductive Step\nNow, we want to derive the $V_t^\\star$ (for the \"previous\" step) given $V^\\star_{t+1}$. Since we're working backwards in time, the time subscripts are the opposite of $(6)$.\n$$V_{t}^\\star(s) = \\min_a \\left[ c(s,a) + V_{t+1}^\\star(s_{t+1}) \\right] \\tag{7}$$\nLet's make the inductive hypothesis that $V^\\star_{t+1} = s_{t+1}^T P_{t+1} s_{t+1}$ for some PSD matrix $P$.\n\nWhat's the motivation for choosing this inductive hypothesis? We assume by induction that $V^\\star$ for \"later timesteps\" has already been computed. This means that $V$ for these timesteps has already minimized over all possible actions. Then, $V^\\star$ can be encoded as some function of the state only. We choose it to be a quadratic function parameterized by some PSD matrix $P$ (this makes it easier to optimize).\n\nPlugging in $c$ and $V^\\star_{t+1}$, then, we get\n$$V_{t}^\\star(s) = \\min_a \\left[ s^TQs + a^TRa + s_{t+1}^T P_{t+1} s_{t+1}) \\right] \\tag{8}$$\nSince $Q$, $R$, and $P$ are all positive semi-definite, the inside of the $\\min$ is a convex quadratic function. Thus, taking the gradient of the inside with respect to $a$ and setting it to $0$ will yield the optimal $a$.\nThis is a nice example of a closed solution to a special type of MDP with an (uncountably) infinite state space!\n","id":"https://tanaybiradar.com/blog/lqr-mdp/","title":"Understanding the Optimal Value Function in LQR MDPs"},"https://tanaybiradar.com/blog/notes-on-zoom-in-circuits/":{"body":"Introduction\nThere's an uncanny overlap between the Effective Altruism and machine learning communities. Even more so in mechanistic interpretability, the subfield of ML that focuses on reverse-engineering and understanding the weights inside neural networks.\nI don't consider myself to have gone that deep in to the EA realm, but I've read a few posts on 80,000 Hours, LessWrong. Some people invested in EA have started programs such as MAIA, STS 10SI, and ARENA. I read some of these pages and Neel Nanda's blog, which led me to reimplement GPT-2 and explore more of the field.\nOne of the \"foundational\" papers is \"Zoom In: An Introduction to Circuits\" by Olah et. al. on Distill.pub. Below are some of my comments and notes on the paper. A lot of the content borrows directly from the source, so all figures and direct quotes are attributed to the paper and OpenAI Microscope.\nClaims 1-2: Neurons + circuits are understandable\nKey ideas:\n\nThe possible activations of a given layer form a vector space. Features are directions in that vector space.\nCircuits are subgraphs of the overall neural network's computational graph. We want to think of them like cells in an organism.\nBoth can be rigorously studied (quantitatively and qualitatively), and qualitative study is still important—even though most ML research focuses on maximizing quantitative benchmarks.\n\nCurve Detectors\n\nWe believe that neural networks consist of meaningful, understandable features. Early layers contain features like edge or curve detectors, while later layers have features like floppy ear detectors or wheel detectors. The community is divided on whether this is true.\n\n\n    \n    \n\nThe authors uncovered curve detection neurons and presented several arguments as to why they detected curves—and not anything else. Note that these curve detectors have an orientation as well: For instance, left-facing curves did not highly activate the right-facing curve detector's neurons.\n\nIf we try to maximize activations of these neurons, we produce curves\nThe training examples that maximized the activations contained curves\nArtificially drawn curves resulted in high activations for these neurons\nRotating the curves reduced the activation for one orientation's neuron, but another orientation's curve-detecting neuron started to fire\n\"We can read a curve detection algorithm off the weights\"\n\"The downstream clients of curve detectors are features that naturally involve curves\"\nWe can manually set weights to implement a curve detector\n\nYou can play with the activations for InceptionV1 and other models using OpenAI's Microscope.\nHigh-Low Frequency Detectors\nHowever, not all features the network learns are obvious: \n\n[Some neurons] look for low- frequency patterns on one side of their receptive field, and high-frequency patterns on the other side. Like curve detectors, high-low frequency detectors are found in families of features that look for the same thing in different orientations.\nThey seem to be one of several heuristics for detecting the boundaries of objects, especially when the background is out of focus.\n\n\n    \n    \n\nDog Detectors\nThe authors also found circuits for detecting for a left-facing dog and a right-facing dog. Those features are then combined to form orientation-invariant dog detectors. (Remember, circuits are just computational subgraphs in the neural network.)\nNote: In the below figure, blue arrows represent negative weights, while red arrows represent positive weights.  The below figure is copied directly from the Distill article.\n\n\n[The network] could easily create invariant neurons by not caring very much about where the eyes, fur and snout went, and just looking for a jumble of them together. But instead, the network has learned to carve apart the left and right cases and handle them separately.\n\nThe negative weights are inhibitors. Concretely: A neuron that implements a left-facing head detector looks at the fur orientation from the previous layer. If the fur is oriented left, then the activation for this left-facing head detector increases. If the fur is oriented right, then that activation is lower!\nPolysemanticity\nIt gets even weirder: Some circuits form a weird combination of \"human-understandable features.\" The authors label this phenomenon the \"polysemanticity of neurons.\" There's no reason a neural network has to \"learn\" in a human-like way; it's remarkable that curve detectors—and even dog detectors (as the paper goes on to discuss)—operate like this at all!\nEven more oddly, neural networks can and sometimes deliberately introduce polysemanticity. If a neuron reads a fur detector, paw detector, and a car detector as input, it may represent a feature that is some weird combination of fur, paw, and car—because of course it doesn't have to behave like a human! It's a pile of linear algebra1!\nThe authors hypothesize that this is done to effectively compress the network's representation of features. It has a finite \"representation space\" that is governed by its depth and the number of weights. Anthropic has an article on this phenomenon, called superposition.\nI came across a Twitter—I mean X—thread the other day that suggests neural networks are just compression. This paper (that I haven't yet read) also appears to suggest the same.\nThis is really annoying for interpretability. Is it possible to train models without inherent polysemanticity? Perhaps we can design some loss function that looks at each neuron and discourages polysemantic neurons from forming. But to do this, we need to quantify what makes a neuron polysemantic—something that hasn't been done yet (at least according to my knowledge).\nClaim 3: Similar circuits form across models\nDo neural networks in general learn in the same ways and develop similar circuits? Evidence suggests yes, but we don't have a good way of really supporting this hypothesis.\nIn this way, finding similar circuits across various models is analogous to finding similar traits across species to classify them. That brings us to interpretability as a natural science...\nThe State of Interpretability\nMaybe neural networks are too complicated, and it's unfeasible to mathematically understand everything that's going on at the top level. But the hope is that we can break things down into circuits—just as biologists broke down life into cells, and physicists broke up the world into atoms (and now subatomic particles).\n\nCircuits sidestep these challenges by focusing on tiny subgraphs of a neural network for which rigorous empirical investigation is tractable. They’re very much falsifiable: for example, if you understand a circuit, you should be able to predict what will change if you edit the weights.\n\nPerhaps \"I found this cool circuit\" doesn't get published into NeurIPS or ICML, but it's still important research. If we can find motifs, what the authors call circuit/feature patterns across models and tasks, we will still be able to form general hypotheses and theories about how machines learn.\nBecause interpretability is a young niche within machine learning, there's so much low-hanging fruit. And that excites me, because it's accessible! If we want a world with human-centered, safe AI, we need interpretability. And we need to ensure that research and development are not centered in the hands of a powerful, elite few. That's why interpretability excites me—and if I haven't convinced you, I hope you read the entire paper to convince yourself, too.\n\n2\nhttps://xkcd.com/1838/\n\n","id":"https://tanaybiradar.com/blog/notes-on-zoom-in-circuits/","title":"Notes: \"Zoom In - An Introduction to Circuits\""},"https://tanaybiradar.com/blog/now/":{"body":"This page is a working list of my short and medium-term projects + goals.\n\nWorking as a ML Engineer @ ChipAgents.ai, training large language models\n\nI also do some application engineering work\n\n\nTraining to earn my private pilot's license (PPL)\n\n","id":"https://tanaybiradar.com/blog/now/","title":"The 'Now' Page"},"https://tanaybiradar.com/blog/on-the-case-for-the-risc/":{"body":"\nAn assignment for CS254 (Advanced Computer Architecture) at UCSB\n\nPersonal computers were booming around the 1980s: Apple released the famous Apple II in 1977 and started selling the Lisa in 1983. Meanwhile, IBM released the IBM Personal Computer in 1981. Around this time, complex instruction set computers (CISCs) dominated the market with VAX, x86, and related instruction sets.\nEven today, CISCs flaunt their huge instruction sets, which make it easy to perform additions, polynomial evaluations, dot products, and even cryptographic functions. They (usually) make programmers’ lives easier by providing a single instruction for common tasks: Function calls don't have to consist of explicit instructions to push arguments onto the stack, link a return address, and jump to the beginning of the function. In x86, all this functionality is wrapped up in an elegant CALL. Your code takes up less disk space, and life is good.\nThis argument is great for marketing teams at computer companies: They can just use “instruction set size” to sell computers. These companies have also been focused on related KPIs such as MIPS (millions of instructions per second) and MHz (GHz today), arguing that \"more megahertz = more performance.\"\nThe problem is that these metrics are a leaky proxy for performance.\nExample: Matrix multiplication\nFor example, when multiplying a ton of matrices, many simple GPU cores that run at MHz speeds will be much faster than a few complex CPU cores running at GHz speeds. Although the GPU runs slower, it has thousands of cores that can each compute dot products in parallel. CPUs have fewer cores, so their throughput is much more limited.\n\n    \n\n(CPU: AnyCore)\nThe Only Way: Evaluate your processor by running the program\nMore available instructions add complexity to the hardware, and adding unnecessary instructions can actually impair performance.\nThat's why application benchmarks are so important.\nAs consumers, we like to evaluate the metrics that companies print on the box. But it's dangerous to just pick a few metrics and blindly optimize for them. We should really be asking, “How fast/efficiently will this processor run my programs?”\nAs computer architects David Patterson and&nbsp;David Ditzel write in \"The Case for the Reduced Instruction Set Computer” 1\n\nUnfortunately, the primary goal of a computer company is not to design the most cost-effective computer; the primary goal of a computer company is to make the most money by selling computers.”\n\nThe Case for the Reduced Instruction Set Computer 1\nMost CISCs have a host of problems: Here are the main ones, as outlined in Patterson and Ditzel's paper:\nUpward compatibility\nCISCs add instructions over time, making the instruction set architecture (ISA) increasingly bloated. Once architects commit to adding an instruction to the ISA, they've effectively locked themselves in for life: Binaries will start using the new instructions; to ensure upward compatibility, the instruction won't disappear in future versions of the instruction set.\nConsequently, it is very hard to get rid of badly designed instructions. Like a tower crumbling under its own weight, the architecture becomes increasingly difficult to support.\nIrrational implementations\nOne of the worst offenders in CISC design is the irrational implementation: An instruction that probably shouldn't exist. For some reason, such as marketing, an unnecessarily complex instruction finds its way into a CISC ISA. In the paper,\n\nOne example was discovered by Peuto and Shustek for the IBM 370 [Peuto,Shustek77]; they found that a sequence of load instructions is faster than a load multiple instruction for fewer than 4 registers.\n\nOne dedicated instruction isn't necessarily faster than several smaller ones. And because architects often demand upward compatibility, these irrational implementations often stay in the ISA.\nRISC simply doesn't have this problem: Although RISCs sometimes support extensions with special-purpose instructions, the base instruction set is simple and rarely changes. It's against the RISC philosophy to introduce anything that might possibly be an irrational implementation.\nCompilers don't use all the instructions\nOf course, CISCs do have useful special-purpose instructions. However, compilers often neglect many of them. Thus, many CISC instructions are effectively useless. In the paper, Patterson and Ditzel write,\n\nMeasurements of a particular IBM 360 compiler found that 10 instructions accounted for 80% of all instructions executed, 16 for 90%, 21 for 95%, and 30 for 99% [Alexander75].\n\nIf users (programmers and compiler writers) rarely use a CISC instruction, is it worth keeping it? After all, limiting the number of instructions in an instruction set has several advantages, such as:\nDesign + fab time effects\nOne of the mantras of the tech industry is \"move fast, break things. While it's probably a bad idea to break things in computer architecture (hardware has to be correct), the companies that win are often the ones that iterate the fastest.\nDesign iteration is necessarily slower for CISCs than for RISCs. Complex instructions introduce more complex logic into the CPU. Hardware becomes more difficult to design and test. Architects are more prone to design errors, and fab yields may even be lower due to the added complexity.\nUltimately, a CISC chip will cost more to produce than a similar RISC chip.\nBetter use of chip area\nAccording to Moore's Law, VLSI design has been getting better and better. So maybe it does make sense to opt for a CISC. However, as the paper argues,\n\nAs VLSI technology improves, the RISC architecture can  always stay one step ahead of the comparable CISC. When the CISC becomes realizable on a single chip, the RISC will have the silicon area to use pipelining techniques; when the CISC gets pipelining  the RISC will have on chip caches, etc.\n\n\n    \n\n A theoretical, completely scientific diagram of performance vs. number of transistors.  \nMaybe there is a region on the curve where CISC outperforms RISC. But in the long run, RISC is likely to be the better choice. As we get more transistors, the paper argues, we're better off spending our silicon on improving other parts of the processor rather than adding increasingly complex instruction logic. Our branch predictors can improve with larger branch history tables, and we can even go multicore!\nAfter all, if many CISC instructions don't even make sense to use, and if compilers only use a few instructions to begin with, it makes more sense to spend our silicon budget on things that are guaranteed to be useful.\nRISC is great (but not a panacea)\nOf course, CISCs can be done well. If there is a special-purpose, complex instruction that allows for huge compiler optimizations, then that instruction is probably worth including. And RISC does have drawbacks: A simpler instruction set, for example, usually requires more memory accesses (which can slow performance) 2.\nIn principle, however, RISC makes sense for most designs. Apple has been demonstrating this with their Apple Silicon: Transistor count scales roughly quadratically with CPU pipeline width. By choosing to build on ARM (RISC), Apple could afford to spend their silicon budget on increasing the pipeline width. And by building these slower-but-wider machines, Apple has leapfrogged its competition with some of the most powerful and efficient consumer machines.\nAs an engineer, I like to solve problems by looking at the simplest solutions first and adding complexity only when necessary. That's why I'm a RISC fan: The philosophy is inherently simpler.\n\n1\nDavid A. Patterson and David R. Ditzel. 1980. The case for the reduced instruction set computer. SIGARCH Comput. Archit.

At any given moment, you need to be clear about what you're doing: weighing different options, gathering data, figuring out what you want.\nCollege\nI'm in college right now, and I don't know exactly what career path I want to pursue. But I'm very consciously trying to narrow it down. I always have a direction that comes from searching for answers to different questions:\n\nLast year I asked myself, \"Do I want to pursue machine learning or quantum computing?\" So I did everything I could to answer that question. I talked to research labs in both fields; after reading papers on quantum error correction and transformer fine-tuning, I decided that quantum computing wasn't for me.\nThis year, I had a new question: \"Do I want to pursue a PhD in ML?\" To answer this new question, I've been taking as many ML courses as I can. Joining a research lab and applying to the BS+MS program at my university are other ways I've been collecting even more data.\n\nBy iteratively asking and answering questions like these, I'll eventually reach my destination. I don't know exactly where it's going to be, but I know I'm going to love it.\nStochastic Gradient Descent\nIntentionally answering your questions like this is similar to following a gradient descent algorithm. The SGD algorithm doesn't find the optimum directly; it takes plenty of bad steps. On average, however, the good steps cancel out the poor ones—and SGD finds an optimal set of parameters.\nSimilarly, we can't directly figure out what will make us the happiest and most fulfilled; we make a lot of mistakes. But as we learn and continue to take deliberate steps to answer our questions, we will hopefully converge on an optimal set of ways to live our lives. That's why I keep asking myself questions, hoping I'll soon converge on a lifestyle that's optimal for me.\n","id":"https://tanaybiradar.com/blog/personal-growth-and-sgd/","title":"Personal Growth and SGD"},"https://tanaybiradar.com/blog/reading-ai-research-papers-harvard-cs197/":{"body":"This is a part of my collection of \"Learn in Public\" notes.

All of a sudden, I can just look at my bucket list and say, \"let's do that one!\" If I wanted to join a club skydiving trip and shorten my bucket list this weekend, I could just go—I don't need to ask anybody for permission. And yes, I do appreciate that I'm fortunate enough to have this freedom.\nGoing to Taiwan\nIn high school, I studied Mandarin for four years—and I've become reasonably fluent. After graduating high school, I once had a conversation with a Chinese tourist while planespotting at SFO—but that was about it. However, outside very few interactions, I never had a chance to really use my Mandarin skills. \nFor the longest time, I thought that wasn't enough of an excuse to drop hundreds of dollars, fly halfway across the world, and spend just a week in Taiwan. Before this trip, I've only left the US to visit relatives in India (and spend a few days exploring Singapore or Hong Kong along the way).\nSo it took me until last summer to book a spring break trip to Taiwan. And it was one of my best uses of money and free will. The people were incredibly kind and helpful, the scenery was beautiful, and I got to make wonderful memories with some of my closest friends. It wasn't a perfect trip by any means—I was exhausted by the end—but it was incredibly worthwhile.\nWe explored Taipei for a few days, trying the food at hole-in-the-wall breakfast shops, night market stalls, and upscale restaurants. We also made a couple day trips to the Tamsui and Jiufen old streets. We then took the high-speed rail to Chiayi and made our way to Alishan. The Alishan national park was incredible, with cherry blossoms and perfect weather in late March. We then spent our last few days in Kaohsiung and back in Taipei.\nBut many of my favorite parts weren't the famous sights or monuments. They were the in-between: talking with locals at small restaurants, sipping warm soymilk, and running to FamilyMart for bottles of cold barley tea. This trip was a first taste, and I'd love to go back. If I had the option, I'd spend a few months living in Taiwan to slowly absorb a little more of everything.\n\n    \n    \n\nTakeaways\n\nsonder (uncountable)\n\n(neologism) The profound feeling of realizing that everyone, including strangers passing in the street, has a life as complex as one's own, which they are constantly living despite one's personal lack of awareness of it.\nWiktionary\n\n\nI realize this every time I travel abroad: everyone around me is living an equally rich, yet completely different, life. The night market vendors worry about completely different things than I do. So do the bus drivers, evening commuters, and 7am patrons at the soymilk shop. This isn't a particularly surprising revelation. Of course I know that people live completely different lives—even here at home. But something about traveling abroad makes me feel and internalize it. Maybe it's the novelty?\nBut in many other ways, we're not that different. I remember walking into vegetarian buffet restaurants, where the (mostly elderly) patrons saw my slightly confused face and happily helped me figure out the process of getting my food. I remember the kind waitress in a Kaohsiung restaurant who excitedly recommended dishes to us, running to get multiple menus and show us what they looked like. I also remember the enthusiastic Buddhist monks who recommended an excellent vegetarian restaurant in Taipei (the best food I had on the trip). I also remember the worker at a pineapple cake store, who joyfully told us about her favorite spots in Taipei. We all like to explore, eat good food, and connect with other people.\nAgain—these weren't particularly surprising revelations. I've been abroad before, but something about traveling alone in a country that doesn't speak my native language helped me internalize them. We grew up on different sides of the world, but somehow, I feel like we're at essence all the same.\n\n    \n    \n\n\n","id":"https://tanaybiradar.com/blog/so-im-just-allowed-to-go-to-taiwan-for-fun/","title":"So, I'm just allowed to go to Taiwan for fun?"},"https://tanaybiradar.com/blog/someday-these-will-be-the-good-old-days/":{"body":"\nI wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them.\n- The Office\n\nIt feels like I started college only about a year ago, but it's two and a half years in, and I'm already looking at my last few months as an undergrad.\nIt's easy to get overwhelmed by the fact that life is finite and time only moves in one direction. So if you're trying to not waste your life, how on earth do you make the most of it? How do you make memories now that you'll treasure later?\nOver the past few days, I've had a series of conversations with my good friend Sam on this very topic. UCSB's Data Science Club has become a home to both us and many of our other officers. So after many meetings, events, adventures, and much joy, it's hard not to number the weeks until graduation. But one piece of Sam's advice stuck with me: You don't treasure moments by how long they last—you treasure them by how deeply you lived them. But how do you tell if you're actually doing that? In her mind, it's easy to fall out of the moment when you focus too much on the clock. In other words, you live deeply when you stop trying too hard to live deeply.\nHere are some notes to myself for the next few months: Go on as many adventures as possible, have more late-night conversations, and spend time with the people that fill you with energy.

I wasn't satisfied by existing explanations of their work, so here's my attempt at something more digestible than the original papers.\n\nI also have some (work-in-progress) code to show for it!\n\nFeatures &amp; Superposition\nAnthropic's Transformer Circuits Thread has had a few previous works that try to interpret the hidden states of deep learning models. Ultimately, the goal is to find meaningful features in models' activations.\nBut what is a feature? We can go by multiple definitions, such as:\n\nAspects of the input data that are meaningful to us humans\nDirections in the activation space of the neural network's layers\n\nSuppose we have an activation vector $a \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, and we're trying to represent two features (according to Definition 1 above)—say \"airplane\" and \"water bottle.\" Here, we have 2 features and 2 dimensions, so we're able to assign orthogonal basis vectors to each feature.\nI trained a toy 1-layer model, following this notebook. More details on that later.\nFor now, here are the actual results (code):\n\n\n    \n\nNote how the features that this toy model has learned don't exactly line up with the standard basis—there's no reason they have to! That's because the models I trained have a non-privileged basis. I can rotate all of the features by some arbitrary rotation matrix $R$, and the model will behave in exactly the same way as it does (provided I also rotate the inputs by $R$).\n\n    \n\n\nSource: Anthropic's Toy Models Paper\n\n\nNow, let's scale things up. Suppose we're instead trying to use represent 3 or 5 features in our activation space $a$. All of a sudden, we can't give each feature its own orthogonal basis direction. We have to squeeze 3 or 5 features into $\\mathbb{R}^2$ somehow—and the best way is to pick directions that have the least overlap/interference (i.e. minimize cosine similarity between any 2 features).\n\nNB 1: There's a beautiful connection to bond angles in chemistry here!\nNB 2: You'll sometimes read that these features form an overcomplete basis for the activation space.\n\nThis phenomenon is called superposition!\n\n  \n    \n        \n    \n    \n        \n    \n  \n\n\n\nActually, I missed one thing: The model won't always spread out the vectors like this. It only does this when every feature occurs somewhat infrequently (sparsely) in the training data.\n\n\nIf the features aren't sparse (they occur frequently in the data), the model chooses to just represent only the most important features in the activation space. In this case, we don't get much superposition.\nIf the features are sparse (they occur infrequently in the data), the model will represent the important features in the activation space. If we have enough important sparse features, the model will use superposition to represent all of them with minimum overlap/interference.\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nSource: Anthropic's Toy Models Paper\n\n\nHere are some intuitive explanations of sparsity and importance:\n\nExample 1: Say we have a model that predicts annual income. It's trained on features ${\\text{attendedCollege}, \\text{occupation}, \\text{hasBrownHair}}$, but only 5% of the dataset examples have brown hair. Since hair color is sparse in this dataset, and it's (probably) not a good indicator of income, then the model will likely send the feature vector representing \"hasBrownHair\" to zero. Superposition (probably) won't happen.\nExample 2: Say we have a model that predicts colorblindness. It's trained on features ${\\text{age}, \\text{citizenship}, \\text{isMale}}$, but the dataset examples are only 5% male. The \"male\" feature is very sparse—it occurs 5% of the time—but when predicting colorblindness, it's very important. So the model will likely not send that feature vector to 0 in the activation space. If there are enough other sparse, important features like \"isMale,\" the model will (probably) represent them all in superposition.\n\n\nOf course, in deep neural nets, this all happens in very high-dimensional vector spaces. But the basic principles are the same.\nDetails on the Toy Model\nThe 1-layer model was a simple model that first tries to map its input $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times n}$ to $\\mathbb{R}^2$, then reconstruct it to get $\\hat{x}$. Formally, with our weight matrix $W \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times 2}$ and bias $b \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$,\n$$h = xW$$\n$$\\hat{x} = \\text{ReLU}(h W^T + b)$$\nWe train using the MSE loss (to push the predictions closer to the original inputs).\nNow we can extract the features from the toy 1-layer model (relatively) easily. Let's look at $W$. Spelled out, we have\n\n$$ x = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 &amp; \\dots &amp; x_n \\end{bmatrix} \\quad W = \\begin{bmatrix} a_0(x_1) &amp; a_1(x_1)\\\\ \\vdots&amp;\\vdots \\\\ a_0(x_n) &amp; a_1(x_n) \\end{bmatrix} $$\n\nThe features are very easy to find in this model: The $i$th row of $W$ corresponds to the $i$th feature, $x_i$,&nbsp;embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Thus, the model represents each feature $x_i$ as the direction of its activation vector, $a(x_i)$. Our $n$ features are then just ${a_1, \\dots, a_n}$. That's it!\nMotivating Sparse Autoencoders: Sparse Dictionary Learning\nWith deeper models, this kind of interpretability isn't easy. We can interpret the weight matrix applied to the input, but what if we want to find meaningful features in deep hidden layer? Maybe we're trying to interpret the activations within hidden state of a transformer (the residual stream), or we're trying to interpret the activations of a deep MLP.\nSparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a popular approach, and Anthropic used them in the Scaling Monosemanticity paper to find interpretable features in Claude 3 Sonnet. Let's motivate them from first principles:\nSay we want to interpret the activations of an intermediate layer of some deep model $f(x)$.\n\n    \n\nOur (substantiated) hope is that in each hidden layer, the model is trying to represent a ton of features that the model learned during training.\nThus, we're trying to analyze an intermediate activation $a$, which is a $d$-dimensional vector that's trying to represent a lot more than $d$ features (ex. \"traffic cone\", \"studying in a library\", \"smokestack\", \"geologist\", etc.). That means we're going to have superposition!\nIf we're trying to find interpretable features from $a$, then we're trying to find a set of directions in the activation space. Each direction in this activation space should correspond to something that makes sense to us humans.\nThe question is, how do we figure out a good set of vectors?\nSince our activation space doesn't have enough dimensions to give each feature its own orthogonal basis vector, why not map $a$ to a \"higher-dimensional space\" that does?\n\nWe don't know exactly how many features $a$ is trying to represent, so we just want to map it to a high-enough dimensional space.\nTo get really in the weeds: My intuition is that we want to map $a$ to a high dimensional space, where it's more likely that each entry in the high-dimensional vector (i.e. each neuron) corresponds to a feature (...at least in a privileged basis, where the standard basis directions are likely more meaningful). We have to be careful about privileged/non-privileged bases when talking about \"neurons corresponding to features.\" In our case, this mapping will be in a privileged basis.\n\nThe idea is that $a$ is some combination of interpretable features in this \"higher-dimensional space,\" which has then been projected into the lower-dimensional activation space. (This map from activation space to the \"higher-dimensional space\" is the dictionary part of sparse dictionary learning.)\nSince $a$ is representing features in superposition, that means the features occurred sparsely in the training dataset. (For any data example, only a few features were present.) Thus, $a$ is a sparse combination of these \"higher-dimensional features.\"\nSo, we want an algorithm that maps $a$ to a sparse vector in this \"higher-dimensional space.\"\nSparse autoencoders do exactly that!\nSparse Autoencoders (SAEs)\nThe structure of a basic autoencoder is pretty simple. It's just an MLP with one hidden layer. It maps the input activation $a$ to a high-dimensional hidden state $h$. Then, using $h$, it computes $\\hat{a}$, a reconstruction of $a$.\nThe intuition is that $h$ will contain some useful information about $a$, since it's an intermediate layer in the computation.\n\n    \n\nIn essence, the SAE computation looks like this:\n$$h = a^TW_\\text{enc}$$\n$$\\hat{a} = \\text{ReLU}(hW_\\text{dec})$$\n$$a \\in \\mathbb{R}^d \\quad W_\\text{enc} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times m} \\quad W_\\text{dec} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times d}$$\nIn reality, Anthropic made a few modifications, but the idea is the same.\nSince we're trying to reconstruct the original input (the activation $a$), we use an MSE loss. But since $a$ is a sparse combination of features in $h$, we also want to ensure that $h$ is a sparse vector—so we add an L1 penalty/regularization term (with hyperparameter $\\lambda$). For a single training example, our SAE loss is\n $$\\mathcal{L}(a, \\hat{a}) = ||a - \\hat{a}||_2^2 + \\lambda ||h||_1$$ \n\nTo be super clear, the original model $f(x)$ was trained on the input dataset. The SAE is trained on $a$, the activations that were gathered from running the original model on a bunch of data.\n\nThere are a few more details (dead neuron resampling, etc.) that improve the utility of the SAEs—but this is the core.\nUsing SAEs to Interpret Model Activations\nNow that we have features, we can interpret them!\nFor large language models, one way we can do this is to prompt them carefully and see what features in the SAE activate. If we input a bunch of prompts related to dolphins to an LLM, collect the activations, run them through the SAE, and see that neuron $i$ in the SAE hidden state consistently activates, then we can be reasonably confident that the $i$th neuron of the SAE correlates with dolphins. (We can't get causal relationships, but correlations are still very useful!)\nOnce we find that the $i$th neuron in the SAE that corresponds to a particular feature (ex. dolphins), we can create a \"fake\" hidden state with only the $i$th neuron active. If we pass that hidden state through the SAE decoder, we can get the direction in the model's activation space that corresponds to that feature! Like a dictionary, we can use the SAE to translate back and forth between interpretable features and directions in activation space!\n\n    \n\nOf course, there are multiple ways to actually use the SAE for interpretability—this is frontier research after all. This is just one possible way.\nFor further reading, I'll point to this section and this section of the Scaling Monosemanticity paper (which are relatively digestible).
