<p> Secluded from the real world, a young student enters the Garden of Productivity, ready to learn the ways of the Master.  </p>

<p class="student">Master, how do I best optimize my workflow?</p>

<p class="master">Have you made sure to use Obsidian?</p>



<p class="student">No, Master. I'll do that right away.</p>

<p class="master">Great. Now set up a Zettelkasten and go away until you've created 10,000 links between different notes.</p>


<p> A few months later, the student reports back to the master.  </p>


<p class="student">I've stored nearly everything I know into the Zettelkasten, Master.</p>

<p class="master">Come back to me after you've started logging every minute for 30 days.</p>



<p class="student">Do I track the time I spend combing my hair?</p>

<p class="master">Once you do that, find out how much time you waste tying shoelaces.</p>



<p>Another month passes, and the student returns to the master.</p>

<p class="master">Great. Remember that Zettelkasten? Folders are easier to search through, and they'll double your productivity. Come back when you've converted your Zettelkasten.</p>



<p>Halfway through reorganizing his notes, the student is agitated.</p>

<p class="student">Master, your teachings aren't helping!</p>

<p class="master">Then leave.</p>



<p class="student">But you promised that I'd reach productivity enlightenment!</p>

<p class="master">You imbecile! It takes time! How many books do you even read each month?</p>



<p class="student">Twelve.</p>

<p class="master">And you <em>dare</em> to think you can reach enlightenment?</p>



<p class="student">How many should I be reading each month?</p>

<p class="master">Eighty-two.</p>



<p class="student">But there are only 24 hours in a day, and each book takes six hours to read!</p>

<p class="master">Then listen to the audiobooks on triple speed.</p>



<p class="student">Then I won't understand anything!</p>

<p class="master">Train your ear. This is the only way to enlightenment.</p>



<p class="student">Butâ€”the other students are reading just four!</p>

<p class="master">And they're way closer to enlightenment than you <em>despite</em> that.</p>



<p class="student">You make no sense! I've gained nothing from doing all this!</p>

<p class="master">Say that again.</p>


<p>At that moment, the student was enlightened.</p>
