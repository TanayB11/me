A friend recently asked me, "Do you have a guiding principle for your life?"

It's hard to pick one thing that I believe in as my North Star. But after a little thinking, I settled on this one: **Don't waste your life.**

A life well lived is one that is not wasted. Which means that there are many wrong ways to live your life, but also plenty of *right* ones. For instance:

1. Open a cafe, raise a goose, and fly planes
2. Become an engineer working on Important Problems
3. Be a great parent and a great friend
4. Be a teacher, mentor, or educator
5. Ideally, do some combination of the above

When I think of a life not wasted, I think about constantly trying to become an excellent personâ€”whatever that means. I think of experimenting with silly ideas and building things. I think of taking care of the people around me and doing "good" (defined in some reasonable way) for other people. I think of continuously learning something and doing [Hard Things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StMltAX0mp0) from time to time. Notably, I do *not* think of getting an absurdly high-paying job or becoming the world's best at something.

It's so easy to live on autopilot and go through years of your lifeâ€”only to realize that you haven't done the things you *actually* want to. The action space of your life is huge, but your actions tend to converge around whatever your peers do. So you're artificially constraining yourself to a subset of the action space.

So, to start exploring, we need to ask ourselves [questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtMLCL_T2ak) like:

1. "What would you do right now if you didn't have to worry about money, time, or what others thought about you?"
2. "What would you do/try/or experiment with if you knew you *couldn't* fail?"
3. "What would you do/try/experiment with even if you knew that you *would* fail?"

What are your responses? They might surprise you.

Maybe you want to quit your job and start a cafe. Work abroad for a few months while building a startup. Go to grad school and become a teaching professor. Or maybe you realize you've been doing it right this whole time.

It doesn't matter *exactly* what you do. But whatever it is, do it with intention.
