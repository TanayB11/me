Success isn't linear. Most progress is one step back, two steps forward. I've
had a lot of [achievements](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanayb11/) over the
past few years, but this isn't the place for that.

It makes my successes better, but more importantly, it paints a realistic picture
of the things I've done. It reminds me that I've worked hard for the things
I care about, and motivates me to keep doing so.

I copied the idea from [Jacky Zhao](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/a-failure-resume).

### 2024
- Other researchers beat me to my project ideas, twice
- Spent an entire quarter on a research project that ended in a negative result
    - Still learned a lot! Distributed training, ViTs, experiment design, etc.
    - Negative results are still [important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOJnOCdBr4s) in science, so depending on how you look at this, it isn't a failure
- Rejected from an undergrad TA position in the CS department for Spring 2024 (even after serving for 2 consecutive quarters)
    - Probably not a reflection of my abilitiesâ€”lots of excellent students I know also didn't get a returning offer
    - Update, Fall 2024: Rejected again
    - Update, Winter 2025: Got the position again!
- Rejected from 3/3 NSF [REUs](https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/)
- Rejected from ~400 internship applications
    - This year's search ended in success, so it technically doesn't
    belong here. I'm leaving it to remind myself how long it can take to see
    results.

### 2023
- Rejected (placed low on waitlist) by [ERSP](https://ersp.cs.ucsb.edu/)
	- Ended up finding a ML research lab and contributing to a [RL project](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06063) anyway, so the above wasn't that big of a deal.
- [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06063) rejected from NeurIPS 2023
    - Ended up getting accepted to the RSS 2024 TaskSpec Workshop (almost a year later!)
- Rejected from an undergrad TA position in the CS department (again)
    - Accepted the 3rd time around for Fall 2023! It's been great
- Gave up on joining a UCSB quantum computing lab and an NLP lab
	- Strategically giving up is not easy. I lost interest in theoretical quantum computing (a la error-correction algorithms) and didn't see a good fit in that NLP lab. In this case, the strategy worked well.

### 2022
- Rejected by 96/96 internship applications
- Rejected from MIT (and all my other top-choice universities)
	- This was particularly disappointing because [SSP](https://summerscience.org/) (an astrophysics program I attended) has abnormally high rates (~20-30%) of alumni who attend there. Learned that hard work doesn't guarantee you'll achieve a specific goal; many things are simply outside your control.
- Rejected from the [Atlas Fellowship](https://www.atlasfellowship.org/)
- Rejected from an undergrad TA position in the CS department
