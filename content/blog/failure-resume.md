Success isn't linear. Most progress is one step back, two steps forward. I've
had a lot of [achievements](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanayb11/) over the
past few years, but this isn't the place for that.

This is my anti-LinkedIn page. It makes my successes sweeter, but more importantly,
it paints a realistic picture of the things I've done. It reminds me that I've
worked hard for the things I care about, and motivates me to keep doing so.

Like the [antilibrary](/blog/antilibrary), I copied this excellent idea from [Jacky Zhao](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/a-failure-resume).

### 2024
- Rejected from an undergrad TA position in the CS department for Spring 2024 (even after serving for 2 consecutive quarters)
    - Probably not a reflection on my performanceâ€”lots of excellent students I know also didn't get a returning offer
- Rejected from 3/3 NSF [REUs](https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/)
- Rejected from ~375 internship applications
    - In the end, I accepted a role to work at Cisco as a SWE intern over the
    summer! This year's search ended in success, so it technically doesn't
    belong here. I'm leaving it to remind myself how long it can take to see
    results.

### 2023
- Rejected (placed low on waitlist) by [ERSP](https://ersp.cs.ucsb.edu/)
	- Ended up finding a ML research lab and contributing to a RL project anyway, so the above wasn't that big of a deal.
- Rejected from an undergrad TA position in the CS department (again)
    - Accepted the 3rd time around for Fall 2023! It's been great
- Gave up on joining a UCSB quantum computing lab and an NLP lab
	- Strategically giving up is not easy. I lost interest in theoretical quantum computing (a la error-correction algorithms) and didn't see a good fit in that NLP lab. In this case, the strategy worked well.

### 2022
- Rejected by 96 of 96 internship positions I applied to
- Rejected from MIT (and all my other top-choice universities)
	- This was particularly disappointing because [SSP](https://summerscience.org/) (a research program I attended) has abnormally high rates (~20-30%) of alumni who attend there. Learned that hard work doesn't guarantee you'll achieve a specific goal; many things are simply outside your control.
- Rejected from the [Atlas Fellowship](https://www.atlasfellowship.org/)
- Rejected from an undergrad TA position in the CS department
