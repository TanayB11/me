This page is a public list of short and medium-term projects + goals. Partly
to <a href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public">share</a> what I'm doing,
partly for accountability. I'll update it as my interests evolve.

I got the idea from <a href="https://garrickvanburen.com/now/">Garrick Van Buren</a>.
