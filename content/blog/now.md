This page is a working list of my short/medium-term projects + goals.

- Taking courses in matrix analysis, graph machine learning, quantum computing
- Working on adversarial robustness research, pretraining small-scale conversational AI models, and possibly something in explainable RL
    - Also trying to find an internship/full-time job in ML
- Learning the guitar, taking more pictures with my camera
- Weightlifting + cardio, meeting my protein goals
