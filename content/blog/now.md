This page is a public list of short and medium-term projects + goals. Partly
to <a href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public">share</a> what I'm doing,
partly for accountability. I'll update it as my interests evolve.

I got the idea from <a href="https://garrickvanburen.com/now/">Garrick Van Buren</a>.

- Searching for Summer 2024 internships
- Writing ML lectures/workshops for the UCSB Data Science Club
- Read an exciting RL paper from DeepMind, drafting a blog post
- Developing <a href="https://github.com/TanayB11/cosine">cosine</a>
- Bouldering - climbing V4s
