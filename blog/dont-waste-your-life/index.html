  <h2 class="title">ðŸŒ± don&#x27;t waste your life </h2>
  <p>A friend recently asked me, &quot;Do you have a guiding principle for your life?&quot;</p>
<p>It's hard to pick one thing that I believe in as my North Star. But after a little thinking, I settled on this one: <strong>Don't waste your life.</strong></p>
<p>A life well lived is one that is not wasted. Which means that there are many wrong ways to live your life, but also plenty of <em>right</em> ones. For instance:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open a cafe, raise a goose, and fly planes</li>
<li>Become an engineer working on Important Problems</li>
<li>Be a great parent and a great friend</li>
<li>Be a teacher, mentor, or educator</li>
<li>Ideally, do some combination of the above</li>
</ol>
<p>When I think of a life not wasted, I think about constantly trying to become an excellent personâ€”whatever that means. I think of experimenting with silly ideas and building things. I think of taking care of the people around me and doing &quot;good&quot; (defined in some reasonable way) for other people. I think of continuously learning something and doing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StMltAX0mp0">Hard Things</a> from time to time. Notably, I do <em>not</em> think of getting an absurdly high-paying job or becoming the world's best at something.</p>
<p>It's so easy to live on autopilot and go through years of your lifeâ€”only to realize that you haven't done the things you <em>actually</em> want to. The action space of your life is huge, but your actions tend to converge around whatever your peers do. So you're artificially constraining yourself to a subset of the action space.</p>

    style="border-radius: 0.5em;"/>
</center>
<p>So, to start exploring, we need to ask ourselves <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtMLCL_T2ak">questions</a> like:</p>
<ol>
<li>&quot;What would you do right now if you didn't have to worry about money, time, or what others thought about you?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;What would you do/try/or experiment with if you knew you <em>couldn't</em> fail?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;What would you do/try/experiment with even if you knew that you <em>would</em> fail?&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>What are your responses? They might surprise you.</p>
<p>Maybe you want to quit your job and start a cafe. Work abroad for a few months while building a startup. Go to grad school and become a teaching professor. Or maybe you realize you've been doing it right this whole time.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter <em>exactly</em> what you do. But whatever it is, do it with intention.</p>
