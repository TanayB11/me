  <h2 class="title">ðŸŒ³ Deploying a full-stack web application </h2>
  <p>Between lines of code and a website lies the world of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps">DevOps</a>: &quot;Development Operations.&quot;
Arguably, DevOps is the most overlookedâ€”and challengingâ€”parts of the software
development lifecycle. Nevertheless, it is still an equally crucial process, and
it involves everything from version control to build to deployment and scaling.</p>
<p>The DevOps cycle is not separate from the code: It is a <em>part</em> of the code.
For jadeocr, we used Git for our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control">version control</a>
system and <a href="https://github.com/jadeocr">GitHub</a> as our remote repository and
project management hub. The platform is where we keep track of issues and manage
collaborating on code. We also use GitHub as part of our
<a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-ci-cd">CI/CD pipeline</a>
to automatically build the website and server and make the changes live on the
website.</p>
<p>Pushing code to the master branch of our GitHub repository triggers numerous
GitHub workflows that comprise our CI/CD process. GitHub first sends a ping
across the webâ€”an <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/articles/http-requests">HTTP POST</a>
requestâ€”to our server. After receiving the request from GitHub, a continuous deployment
server written in Node.jsâ€”previously in Golangâ€”quickly goes to work, pulling
the latest code from the GitHub master branch and uses
<a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">Docker Compose</a> to build and start the
application <a href="https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container">containers</a>,
which are isolated environments called in which application code can run. The
server simply executes a series of shell commands after it receives a request
at a particular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API">API</a> endpoint; from a
technical perspective, therefore, this system is quite simple.</p>
<p>Afterward, a GitHub action builds the jadeocr-next client and the server into
their respective Docker images and publishes them to the
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/packages/guides/about-github-container-registry">GitHub Container Registry</a>.
These containers solve the common issue of &quot;it works on my machine&quot; and make
building, deploying, and scaling applications with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes">Kubernetes</a> relatively straightforward
<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. Although I faced several (frustrating) hurdles while writing the
initial configuration files for these Docker containers, managing them after
the initial setup process has been a breeze.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most complex individual cog in this software
development machine is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx">Nginx</a> (Engine-X)
server and reverse proxy. Nginx is simply a web server, but it can also function
as a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/reverse-proxy/">reverse proxy</a>
to direct web traffic to its intended destination. We use Nginx in two places:
in front of the website's static files and in front of the entire website.</p>
<p>When we build the website files into the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that the
browser renders after loading <a href="https://next.jadeocr.com">jadeocr-next</a>, our web
framework's build tool, <a href="https://cli.vuejs.org/">Vue CLI</a>, creates a directory
of static files that must be served by a web server. Therefore, we use Nginx in
front of the client to serve these static files. We then use <em>another</em> Nginx
server in our cloud virtual machine to direct API requests to our web server
and website requests to the aforementioned client Nginx server. </p>
<p>Although each system is fairly simple on its own, the confluence of all these
tools in a single pipeline creates many moving parts which are challengingâ€”but
funâ€”to manage. Perhaps such a DevOps system is overkill for such a small
application, but it provides jadeocr-next with the ability to easily scale and
avoid future errors. Most importantly, however, going through this DevOps
journey has been a valuable and fulfilling experience for meâ€”even if I do
sometimes spend multiple days staring at a terminal window in confusion.</p>

<p>For now, we are running jadeocr-next on a virtual private server (VPS),
but we do plan to deploy a Kubernetes cluster in the future.</p>
