  <h2 class="title">ðŸŒ± retracing my steps </h2>
  <p>i took a detour...</p>
<p>nearly 9 years ago, in april 2015, i walked into my first speed-cubing competition. a few years later, i started uploading youtube videos about rubik's cubes.</p>
<p>i was 12 then, and in some ways i was more brave than i am now. i had filmed a travel vlog. i had auditioned for the main character in the class playâ€”with a comical impression of a british accent. i had rickrolled an entire class.</p>
<p>college-sophomore me couldn't be more proud.</p>
<p>perhaps i paint pieces of my past with extra colorâ€”but where did that shameless, cringeworthy part of myself go?</p>
<p>it wasn't middle-school, where we ran laps in a collared shirt and tie. it was my high schoolâ€”where we ran laps in shorts and a t-shirt.</p>
<hr />
<p>for context, one of my biggest goals in high school was to get into mit. at my bay area high school, therefore, college admissions crept into nearly every decision i made.</p>
<p>it was in some ways a blessing: it gave me the extra push to work on fulfilling projects like <a href="https://github.com/jadeocr/jadeocr-next">jadeocr</a> and discover a love of teaching in the computer science club. but it was also a curse.</p>
<p>why didn't i learn to play the guitar or go bouldering? i was afraid that it was too late to start something new. if there were six-year-old guitar and climbing prodigies, how would i ever compete?</p>
<p>clearly, i missed the point. i forgot how to have fun.</p>
<p>instead, i busied myself with things that didn't really matterâ€”like <a href="http://www.usaco.org/">contests i hated</a>â€”for my applications. i eventually spent so much time studying and working on projects that my social skills also declined.</p>
<p>my time became so centered on &quot;work&quot; that i neglected everything else i could spend time on.</p>
<hr />
<p>in college, i finally realized how absurd it was that:</p>
<ol>
<li>i've been afraid to make eye contact with people.</li>
<li>i've thought too much about asking friends to eat lunch/dinner together.</li>
<li>i've hesitated to ask strangers to watch over my bag at a coffee shop.</li>
<li>i forgot how to start new hobbies.</li>
</ol>
<p>but over the past two years, i've been re-learning how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>embrace discomfort. even in small things.
<ul>
<li>i've attended bhangra practices with no dance experience and joined 45-mile bike rides with near-strangers.</li>
<li>i've attended friends' casual gatherings, even with few familiar faces around.</li>
<li>write and publish blog posts like this one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ask for what i want
<ul>
<li>ask people to watch over my items at coffee shops.</li>
<li>this skill has also helped my academic life. i've asked professors to make me the first learning assistant for an ml course and allow me into classes that i don't meet prerequisites for.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>have fun
<ul>
<li>i'm finally learning to play the guitar, cook, and climb!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>i don't want to be a copy of my 12-year-old self, but i have some lessons to learn from him. that's why i'm retracing my steps.</p>
