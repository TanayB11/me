  <p>Hello! 👋🏽</p>

  <p>
    I'm a CS student at UC Santa Barbara. I work with software and machine learning
    to improve our lives (which can mean a lot of things).
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm currently working in adversarial robustness, ML safety/interpretability,
    and democratizing access to ML models. I also love to teach!
  </p>

  <p>
    My hobbies currently include cooking and learning to play the guitar.
  </p>

  <p>
    I occasionally write here. Here are some places you may want to visit:

  <ul>
    <li>My <a href="/blog/now">"now"</a> page: a public list of projects + goals</li>
    <li>My <a href="/blog/antilibrary">antilibrary</a>: a collection of books: read, being-read, and to-be-read</li>
    <li>My <a href="/blog/failure-resume">torn-out pages</a>: a failure resume</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Send me a <a href="mailto:me@tanaybiradar.com">message</a> if you'd like to get in touch.
    See you around!
