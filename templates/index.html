  <h2>Hello! 👋🏽</h2>

  <p>
    I'm a CS student at UC Santa Barbara. I aim to work with awesome tech
    while solving issues I care about — climate change, urban planning,
    pedagogy, privacy.
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently, I'm most interested in
    <a href="https://github.com/TanayB11/pylot">reinforcement learning</a>,
    but I've previously spent significant time on software engineering
    <a href="https://github.com/jadeocr/">projects</a>.
    I also love to
    <a href="https://github.com/quantum-computing-initiative/quantum-computing-lessons">teach</a>!
  </p>

  <p>
    My hobbies (currently) include cooking, bouldering, cycling, and playing
    <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I sometimes write about my thoughts — tech-related and otherwise —
    <a href="/blog">here</a>.  Here's <a href="/now">what I'm doing</a>.
  </p>
