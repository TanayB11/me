  <p>Hello! 👋🏽</p>

  <p>
    I'm a student at UC Santa Barbara, and I focus on software + machine learning.
  </p>

  <p>
    I work towards using these tools to do real good for humans.
    Recently, I've been researching ML safety, robustness, and interpretability.
  </p>

  <p>
    My hobbies currently include cooking and learning to play the guitar.
