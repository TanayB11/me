    <h2>What I'm Doing Now</h2>

    <p>
      This page is a public list of short and medium-term projects + goals. Partly
      to <a href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public">share</a> what I'm doing,
      partly for accountability. I'll update it as my interests evolve.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Finishing my website redesign and writing more <a href="/blog">blogs</a></li>
      <li>Reading <em>A Short History of Nearly Everything</em> by Bill Bryson</li>
      <li>Bouldering - climbing V4s</li>
    </ul>
